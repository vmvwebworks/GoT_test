Myranda is Ramsay Bolton's lover, and much like him had a cruel and sadistic nature, taking pleasure in inflicting pain and killing.","Myranda was a servant of House Bolton of the Dreadfort, her father being the castle's kennelmaster. She was one of Ramsay Snow's bedwarmers, and part-time helper in some of his torture sessions.","Myranda was a cruel, wily girl with an uncontrollable sadistic streak and sexual urges, which induces a combination thereof, especially throughout the way she assists in the torture of Bolton prisoners, making her equally as wild and sociopathic as her lover, Ramsay. Myranda was deceitful, able to use her sexuality and soft-spoken demeanor to lull victims into a false sense of security before revealing her true nature. Seemingly shy, she does not rage or openly express, but has a perverse pleasure from mutilating or murdering helpless victims.
A noticeable personality trait of Myranda, aside from this, is her jealous nature, especially when it comes to Ramsay, whom she has become extremely possessive over. Such behavior was also displayed when she forced herself upon the imprisoned Theon Greyjoy but grows rather frustrated when he pays more attention to Violet than with her and how she ran down another of Ramsay's lovers, Tansy through the woods with a pack of dogs but states she was jealous of her presence, bitterly preparing to shoot an arrow through her face because ""she thinks she's pretty"". This was seen specifically with Sansa Stark, who became wed to Ramsay, like many others such as Shae and Lysa Arryn, Myranda grew envious over her highborn status and great beauty, repeatedly making threats against her life and threatening to mutilate her before her death.
Despite her sociopathic ways, Myranda does seem to genuinely care about Ramsay, even if he only saw her as a thing to entertain him and was willing to abandon her if she grew boring. She was naive enough, however, to believe him when he said the two would marry one day. This may suggest her feelings for him may be love, or simply misinterpreted as lust. Nevertheless, the relationship is not entirely black-and-white as Ramsay kept her around longer than most of his bedwarmers and even gave a eulogy, vowing revenge on those who killed her before telling Maester Wolkan to feed her corpse to the dogs.","3, 4, 5, 6","",Deceased,Thrown from a rampart by Theon Greyjoy for threatening Sansa Stark,"",House Bolton,Northmen,"","","",Unnamed kennelmaster,"","","","",Ramsay Bolton,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/92/Myranda.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161215025334,Myranda,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/71/VioletMyranda.jpg,Violet and Myranda.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3a/MyrandaS4Bow.jpg,Myranda hunts with Ramsay.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c2/Sansa_Myranda-Kill_the_Boy.jpg,Myranda introduces herself to Sansa.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/fa/MyrandaDeath.jpg,Myranda lies dead in the Winterfell courtyard after being thrown over a rampart by Theon Greyjoy,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/8a/MyrandacorpseBrightened.jpg,Myranda's corpse is mourned by Ramsay.,"","","","",House Bolton

Without the Valyrians and their dragons to keep them in check, the Dothraki swept across Essos. During this time Temmo commanded a khalasar numbering in the tens of thousands.
Temmo was finally stopped, however, by a force of 3,000 Unsullied warrior-eunuchs during the Battle of Qohor. The Dothraki could easily have outflanked the Unsullied, but by tradition they scorn infantry, and thinking of them as easily ridden down. On this occasion, however, the lockstep phalanxes of the Unsullied held firm, and fearlessly resisted his khalasar's assaults. By the end of the battle only 600 Unsullied remained, but 12,000 Dothraki had been killed, including Temmo and his sons.

Arya Stark states that he was one of the greatest swordsmen that ever lived; this is proven true as he single-handedly defeated five armored Kingsguard with a wooden training sword. Syrio never wore armor in combat and preferred light weaponry, as the Water Dance strongly relies on agility and being light on one's feet. He often used his enemies use of armor to his advantage in a fight, wearing them down and outmaneuvering them with his speed before finishing them off. Syrio's lack of armor and strong weapons, however, might have resulted in his downfall against Meryn Trant. Sandor Clegane jests that even through Syrio might have been ""the greatest swordsman who ever lived"", he lost to the cowardly and weak Trant solely because the knight had a big sword and armor. Syrio's teaching style could be considered unusual but effective. During lessons with Arya, he taught her that in combat the sword and the one holding it should be one, and to teach her mobility and dexterity, had her chase cats around the Red Keep.
Syrio seemed to lack faith in the Old Gods and the New, claiming the only true God is Death, as everyone succumbs to Him eventually. He possesses a warrior's belief in this, however, claiming that the only thing one says to Death is ""not today"". Courageous, implacable and fearsome, Syrio showed no visible fear even when faced with Meryn Trant and deprived of his only weapon's effectiveness. Syrio had a very observant view on Westerosi combat, considering it to be little more than hacking and hammering, in that it lacked elegance or precision (An opinion only acceptable from a master swordsman, naturally), and he had a sense of honour as evidenced by his disgust that Meryn Trant's men would have the gall to threaten a little girl. Syrio Forel was obviously quite charismatic, as he inspired Arya's behaviour after his death: She was motivated to kill Meryn Trant for killing Syrio, and continued to utilise his lessons after he allowed her to escape from Cersei Lannister's men.",1,The First Sword of Braavos,"Uncertain; last seen fighting Ser Meryn Trant, likely deceased","",Braavos,"House Stark, Sealord of Braavos",Braavosi,Many-Faced God,"","","","","","","","",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/63/Syrio_Forel.png/revision/latest?cb=20120722210850,Syrio Forel,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0c/Syrio_Forel.jpg,Syrio is hired to teach Arya Stark the ways of a water dancer.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a2/Syrio_Forel_1x08.png,Syrio duels Ser Meryn Trant.,"","","","","","","","","","",House Stark

In rage, the gods sent a storm to destroy his keep over Shipbreaker Bay, killing his family and guests. Declaring war against them, Durran built new castles, each larger and more formidable than the previous one, though all were the destroyed by the divine storms. Finally, the seventh castle, which Durran built with the aid of either the Children of the Forest or a very young Bran the Builder, withstood the rage of the gods and became known as Storm's End, while Durran earned the nickname of ""Durran's Godsgrief"" and ruled as the first Storm King.

Varys,"Varys, sometimes called the Spider, is a major character in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. He initially appeared as a recurring character in the first season and debuted in ""Lord Snow"". He is played by starring cast member Conleth Hill. Varys is a eunuch and was the Master of Whisperers on the King's Small Council until he is forced to flee King's Landing with Tyrion Lannister. He is a skilled manipulator and commands a network of informants across two continents.  
Although he feigns support for her assassination while serving under King Robert Baratheon, Varys's true loyalties are eventually revealed to be to Daenerys Targaryen (though she herself is initially unaware of this), as he believes her rule would be the best way to preserve peace and prosperity in the Seven Kingdoms. He and Tyrion travel to Meereen, joining Daenerys's Small Council. After assisting Tyrion, Grey Worm and Missandei with the rule of Meereen in their Queen's name, Varys returns to Westeros and rallies House Tyrell of the Reach, and the Sand Snakes of Dorne for Daenerys's cause against House Lannister. ","Varys was born across the Narrow Sea in Lys. He was born a slave, and as a child he traveled with a troupe of actors all around the different Free Cities until a sorcerer in the city of Myr made an offer Varys's master couldn't refuse. Varys was sold to the sorcerer, who gave him a potion that made him unable to move or speak but didn't dull his perceptions or sense of pain, and emasculated him (cutting off his testes and penis both) so he could use his sexual organs in a magical ritual, burning them in a brazier. When the sorcerer had thrown Varys's genitals in the brazier, the fire turned blue, the sorcerer called and a voice replied back. Afterward, the sorcerer had no more use for Varys and threw him in the streets to die. Instead, Varys resolved to live no matter what: begging, stealing, and selling the sexual use of what parts remained to him, doing anything to survive. He also became an excellent thief, but soon learned that stolen information was often a far more valuable commodity than any physical goods, and he worked his way up from the slums of Myr. He later started a pick-pocketing business with Illyrio Mopatis and eventually founded a group of spies that he would called his ""Little birds"". He became a master spy and information trafficker, and his influence and reputation grew so great that he eventually found himself as a member of the Small Council in the Seven Kingdoms. He became one of the chief advisers to Aerys II Targaryen, who at that time, did not trust his wife Rhaella Targaryen, his son Rhaegar Targaryen or his Hand of the King Tywin Lannister. His experience at the hands of the sorcerer had also left him with a bitter hatred for magic and its practitioners. As a member of the King's Small Council, he serves as the Master of Whisperers, the King's foremost spymaster and intelligence agent. He holds no inherited title, castle, or lands in Westeros, but is called ""Lord"" as a courtesy due to his position on the council, which traditionally is made up of high lords.
When the Mad King arrested Brandon Stark for threatening Prince Rhaegar, Varys and the rest of the Small Council urged the King to pardon Brandon on the grounds that he was the heir to Winterfell and the Prince had abducted his sister. However, the King refused to heed their advice and had both Brandon and his father brutally executed. This led to a rebellion that ultimately toppled the Targaryen dynasty.
When Tywin arrived at King's Landing with the entire Lannister army at his back, professing loyalty to his beleaguered King after the rebels resounding victory at the Battle of the Trident, Varys warned Aerys not to open the gates, as did Tywin's own son in the Kingsguard, Jaime Lannister. However, Grand Maester Pycelle told Aerys what he wanted to hear: that he could trust Lord Tywin. So Aerys opened the gates and Tywin sacked the city, and Jaime wound up stabbing Aerys in the back.
Despite his previous loyalty to the Targaryens, Varys was pardoned by the new King Robert Baratheon and allowed to keep his position on the Small Council under the advice of his Hand, Jon Arryn.
Varys is bald, soft, and fat, due to his castration. He often puts on the public persona of being nothing more than a pudgy man well suited to the pleasantries of court life; humble, obsequious, fawning, and a little effeminate. This is simply a facade that Varys has developed, which often leads those who do not know him well to underestimate him as a cheerful and vapid flatterer. In reality he is a cunning and ruthless manipulator of court politics, on-par with Master of Coin Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish, with whom he frequently spars. Unlike Baelish, Varys insists that his goals are to achieve what he honestly feels is best for the realm, though of course, what he and the current ruler feel is best might be two separate things.
However, despite his ruthlessness and skill at court politics, Varys does not seek power for his own personal ends, but for the good of the common people in both Westeros and Essos. Thus, his loyalty to a monarch depends on how beneficial that monarch is to their subjects. Varys has a genuinely compassionate side, especially where children are concerned (even the children of his opponents). He once sadly remarked to Eddard Stark that ""it's always the innocents who suffer"", and told Vala that he has never harmed or sought to harm a child, as he considers them blameless.
He is disparagingly known as ""The Spider"" due to his vast web of intelligence sources. His sophisticated intelligence network - one of the largest in the world - spans both Westeros and Essos, as far as Vaes Dothrak and even Qarth. He refers to his agents and sources of information, many of which are low-born children, as his ""little birds"". Unlike Baelish, however, Varys is not indifferent or cruel towards his employees; he educates them, gives them sweets and provides them with protection in return for the information they bring him.
One of his jobs was to keep an eye on the movements of the Mad King's surviving heirs, Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen, and ensure they do not become a threat to King Robert's reign.","Varys is a mysterious man if ever there was one. He is completely unpredictable, in no small part thanks to his stoic, calm and reserved demeanour and his ability to wade through one confrontation after another without losing his dignity, temper or advantage. He frequently claimed that his one and only ambition was to accomplish and to achieve for the good of ""the realm"", although exactly what this means is extremely subjective to those unaware of his true loyalties. Varys is one of the very few people in Westeros who possess immense political power and do not intend to sit on the Iron Throne themselves. He never appears to serve one side for long at all, and may not have served that side in the first place when all is said and done, and nobody appears capable of trusting him.
Varys, in spite of appearing subservient and passive, is an extremely intelligent man, a master of deception, manipulation and calculation. Varys's subtle and calculative nature is made more impressive by him owning the most prominent spy network in all of Westeros, which is only matched by the spy network of Petyr Baelish. Despite having a mutual rivalry and hatred for one another, both Baelish and Varys are incredibly similar: they appear to be sycophantic and meek, but are in fact shockingly ruthless and possess powerful intellect, they both have vast networks of personal spies, traitors and double agents that are entirely at their disposal, and they both hailed from humble backgrounds which inspired them into becoming the men they are today. Varys and Littlefinger have such a rivalry with one another so unusually complex that they are able to spar verbally with one another intensely without ever coming to blows. Instead they calmly insult one another as quickly and as precisely as two master swordsmen sparring to the death. However, while Littlefinger has a personal ambition to take all of the reachable power there is in the Seven Kingdoms for himself and eliminate anyone who obstructs him, Varys dedicates himself to be the ultimate kingmaker and is hell-bent on restoring what he sees as prosperity to Westeros. For all their similarities, the pair are antithetical to each other.
Entirely in spite of his reserved and subtle demeanor, Varys is an extremely dangerous man who is capable of unspeakable cruelty and ruthlessness — though usually only when absolutely necessary. He is not above threatening people to get what is required for his plans, but is also willing to give other players fair warning when warranted. For instance, when Tyrion threatened to throw him into the sea, Varys serenely retorted that he would simply survive and come back to return the favor.
Varys is a survivor of the highest order. He compares the game of thrones to a dangerous body of water and says that he will ""keep on paddling"" through powerful storms, dangerous tides and fish eating each other. Having survived Robert's Rebellion and the War of the Five Kings with nary a scratch, it seems his metaphor is quite apt. Even so, Varys is not incapable of fear: when he was emasculated by a sorcerer, the most terrifying part of the entire experience was when the sorcerer threw his pieces into a fire and a voice answered the sorcerer's call. Varys would spend the rest of his life having nightmares about that voice, becoming painfully introduced to the horrors of the real and supernatural world. He has since developed a disdain for magic in general, especially blood magic, seen when his calm facade falters while confronting High Priestess Kinvara.
Varys's calm facade also masks a somewhat vengeful nature, as he exhausted a great deal of influence to find and capture the sorcerer who castrated him. Varys tells Tyrion, upon observing the bound sorcerer, that revenge is perfectly within his reach, provided that he has the 'stomach' for such a thing—and leaves him alive, intending to take his time and savor the revenge he had long sought. However, with this notable exception, Varys usually does not employ his more ruthless nature unless necessary. He will betray, lie and kill without hesitation, yet he does not do so for his own enjoyment but strictly for the fulfillment of his plans and for his own survival.
Despite his temperament as a skilled manipulator and unwillingness of others around him to trust people like him, he is not incapable of making true friends at a personal level. Tyrion Lannister is the most notable example. Initially saving the dwarf due solely to the fact that he perceived Tyrion to be essential in his plans, Varys and Tyrion eventually develop an amiable friendship during Tyrion's tenure as Hand of the King, enough for Varys to express regret at testifying against him and to put effort into smuggling him to Essos to survive and serve Daenerys.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","Master of Whisperers, (to Aerys II, Robert I, Joffrey I, Tommen I, and Daenerys I)",Alive,"","Lys, the Free Cities","House Targaryen, House Baratheon of King's Landing",Lysene,"","",Qyburn (to Tommen Baratheon),"","","","","","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/cd/Varys_Season_6.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160211211256,Varys,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/ac/Aerys_and_Varys.jpg,Varys serving the Mad King.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/68/Varys.jpg,Varys meets with Lord Eddard.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/60/Varys_and_Illyrio.jpg,Varys and Illyrio conspire under the Red Keep.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/91/Tyrion_and_Varys.jpg,Varys and Tyrion on the walls.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/78/Tyrion%2C_Varys_and_Bronn.jpg,"Varys, Tyrion, and Bronn look at maps.",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e5/What%27s_in_the_box_Varys%3F_What%27s_in_the_box%3F%21.jpg,Varys's long awaited revenge.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/6c/Shae_with_varys.png,Varys gives Shae a bribe of diamonds to leave.,House Targaryen

Jon Snow,"King Jon Snow is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons. He is played by starring cast member Kit Harington, and debuts in the series premiere.
Though presented as the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark, Jon is actually the son of Lady Lyanna Stark, Eddard's sister, and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone. From infancy, Jon is raised by Eddard as his own alongside his lawful children at Winterfell but his true parentage is kept secret from everyone, including Jon himself. In order to escape his bastard status, Jon joins the Night's Watch and is eventually chosen as Lord Commander. However, his decision to allow thousands of Free Folk safe passage through the Wall alienates many of his black brothers, culminating in a mutiny where Jon is killed but later revived by Melisandre. Freed from his Night's Watch vows, Jon executes the mutineers and joins his cousin, Sansa Stark, in building an army to retake Winterfell from House Bolton. After securing help from a few other Northern Houses and the Vale of Arryn, they successfully retake the castle from Ramsay Bolton, restoring House Stark's dominion over the North with Jon being declared the new King in the North by the Northern Lords.","","Because he was raised by Ned Stark at Winterfell, Jon has adopted a clear moral compass and a true sense of honor, which he tries his hardest to abide by even when he must make a difficult decision, especially after he became Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He has always admired and idolized his father, but due to Catelyn Stark's cold disdain for Jon, Eddard was careful not to give him more attention than his lawful children by Catelyn. Lady Stark was never actively mean to Jon, but because he wasn't her own son she intentionally ignored him (as is common for bastard children), meaning that Jon grew up without a mother-figure. Nor did Jon consider Catelyn's behavior to be unusual or unexpected: it is rare for a noble to raise their bastard child alongside their lawful children, and his presence was a great insult to her honor. While his interactions with Catelyn remained awkward or nonexistent, he actually became good friends with his half-siblings, particularly Robb and Arya. Robb was of the same age as Jon so they became playmates and comrades in training, while due to her tomboyish personality Arya was also something of a social misfit like Jon, which they bonded over.
Like many bastard children, Jon had to learn to grow up quickly. This made Jon mature and perceptive beyond his age, so he could navigate his complicated relationships within the Stark household. His bastard status has also made Jon something of a loner, solemn and somber with a desire to prove himself to society and to his father. Jon thought that the best way for a bastard in his position to gain honor and respect was to join the Night's Watch, emulating his uncle Benjen, because past social status is ignored after joining the Watch. Despite his introverted demeanor, Jon is very compassionate and protective of his fellow outcasts such as Samwell Tarly, Grenn, and Pyp.
In many ways, Jon has been unusually lucky for a bastard child, given how rare it is for a lord to raise one in his own castle alongside his lawful children. For all of Jon's misgivings about not knowing his mother and Catelyn ignoring and shunning him, he was loved by his father and siblings, was never poor or hungry, but lived in a castle and always had a roof over his head. Jon was also formally trained in swordsmanship by Ser Rodrik Cassel, and excelled at it. This made Jon somewhat arrogant when he was a new recruit at Castle Black, until Tyrion pointed out that the other recruits were all far less fortunate than he was. This humbles Jon, and he changes his behavior to be the champion of the other downtrodden recruits, and helps train them by walking them through the swordplay techniques he knows.
The Starks were an interfaith household, with Eddard and Catelyn's children being exposed to not only the religion of the Old Gods of the Forest worshiped by most Northmen, but also Catelyn's devout adherence to the Faith of the Seven. Because Jon had no real interaction with Catelyn, and revered his father Eddard, he was not exposed to the Seven but proudly keeps to the Old Gods, and honors the traditions of his First Men ancestors. When Jon took his vow to become a member of the Night's Watch, he chose to do so in front of a heart tree, sacred to the Old Gods.
Jon is also fairly shy around women, and as he revealed to Samwell, he was a virgin when he joined the Night's Watch. While he was attractive enough, as a bastard son with nothing to inherit he had no realistic marriage prospects with noblewomen. Jon was even wary of having sex with random girls or prostitutes (as Theon did), because he was terrified of fathering a bastard of his own: having lived his life as a bastard, he felt that it wasn't a life another child should have to go through.
However, death has changed Jon. Despite his honorable convictions and previous commitment to the Night's Watch, his experience being murdered by his own men and then revived has made Jon far more cynical and nihilistic. No longer believing in himself and his ability to face the coming threat, due to being murdered for doing what he thought was right - Jon abandons the Night's Watch, despite knowing full well how dangerous the threat looming beyond the Wall really is. He loses his determination about fighting and becomes much more lonely and melancholic only speaking when he hasn't any other choice. Also, Jon feels remorse for hanging his former steward Olly, even though the latter did murder both him and the woman he loved. While he is wary of conflict since his return, his love for his family has brought him back into the fight. To this end, Jon chooses his family over the Night's Watch - a choice he once attempted to make when Robb marched off to war, but forsook in the past. When Ramsay decides to play a ""game"" with Rickon, Jon once again chooses his family by attempting to save his little brother's life, even at the cost of his own life and battle plans.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","King in the North, 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch (formerly)",Alive (resurrected),Stabbed to death by his own men in the Mutiny at Castle Black (later resurrected),"Tower of Joy (birthplace), Winterfell (raised)","House Stark, Night's Watch",Northmen,Old Gods of the Forest,"","","Biological:, Rhaegar TargaryenAdoptive:, Eddard Stark",Lyanna Stark,"","","Paternal half-siblings:, Rhaenys Targaryen, Aegon Targaryen Maternal cousins raised as half-siblings:, Robb Stark, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Bran Stark, Rickon Stark,",Ygritte,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/49/Battle_of_the_Bastards_08.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160615184845,Jon Snow,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/ec/Abduction_of_Lyanna_Stark.png,Artistic depiction of Rhaegar Targaryen abducting Lyanna Stark.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/be/The_Winds_of_Winter_22.jpg,"Young Ned Stark found his sister Lyanna dying after she gave birth to Rhaegar Targaryen's last living child, whom Ned then passed off as his own bastard son, ""Jon Snow"".",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/19/Game-of-Thrones-S6-Ep10-The-Winds-of-Winter-Baby-Jon-Snow.jpeg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20160704072306,Jon Snow as an infant.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/35/Jon_and_Robb.png,Jon and Robb play with snowballs in their childhood.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f6/Winter_is_Coming_Bran_Robb_Jon.png,Jon and Robb instruct Bran.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/70/Screen_Shot_2013-06-16_at_12.18.27_AM.png,Jon finds Ghost beside the pup's dead mother.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/43/Arya_and_Needle.jpg,"Needle, the sword that Jon gave to his half-sister Arya as a going-away present.",House Stark

Sandor Clegane,"Sandor Clegane, nicknamed The Hound, is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, sixth and seventh seasons. He is played by starring cast member Rory McCann and debuts in the series premiere. Sandor is the younger brother of Gregor Clegane and was the personal bodyguard (sworn shield) of Joffrey Baratheon.","Sandor Clegane is a skilled warrior in the service of House Lannister, known primarily for the horrible facial scarring he bears on the right side of his face and for his fierce demeanor and lack of chivalry. Sandor is the younger brother of Ser Gregor Clegane, nicknamed ""the Mountain"", a monstrously huge knight and arguably the most feared man in Westeros. In his youth, Gregor nearly burned off half of Sandor's face because he found Sandor playing with a toy that Gregor had discarded. Sandor didn't even ""steal"" it, he was merely playing with it and assumed he didn't need Gregor's permission. Without warning or uttering a word, however, Gregor grabbed Sandor and ""punished"" him by holding his head into a burning brazier. Gregor was only forced to stop after half a dozen servants managed to pry him away from his brother. The incident left severe burn scars over the right half of Sandor's face, thus he usually wears his hair long on that side to cover them. Ever since, Sandor has been deeply afraid of fire.
Although not as large as his older brother, Sandor is very large and a formidable fighter in his own right, considered one of the most skilled and dangerous men in Westeros. Sandor gutted his first man in combat when he was twelve years old (given the date, this was probably as a young soldier during Robert's Rebellion). Sandor finds killing to be the best thing in the world, and although he isn't a crazed killer who will murder anyone regardless of the law like his brother, he cynically pursues occupations as a bodyguard and soldier which allow him to kill legally--though he scoffs at the hypocrisy of people who think there's really much of a difference. After seeing his brother knighted by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen despite being an infamously dishonorable man, Sandor became jaded with knighthood and developed an extreme contempt for romances and songs which present knights and wars as chivalrous and glorious, knowing all too well that supposedly honorable knights frequently butcher the innocent while claiming glory. Thus, Sandor has steadfastly refused to be knighted or take holy vows. Sandor wears a dark set of heavy armor when in battle, and is known to wear a custom helmet shaped like a snarling hound's head, after his family's sigil. He rides a personal warhorse called Stranger, whose namesake is the seventh and final god in the Faith of the Seven who represents death and the unknown.","The Hound is seen as a violent, aggressive and brutal man, with a fatalistic view of the world. He is a formidable warrior and he doesn't hide his love of killing people, believing all men love it, and he generally hates soldiers who try to convince themselves otherwise. However, he also displays small hints at being a reasonably affectionate and compassionate man underneath, particularly in response to Joffrey's treatment of Sansa. This is largely a result of his disgust at the brutality of his older brother Gregor: the respect and knighthood given to Gregor for his extreme brutality left Sandor thoroughly disillusioned that honorable men succeed in the real world the way they do in romantic songs. His growing disgust at Joffrey's sadism and concern for both of the Stark girls, however, show that he is not yet so cynical that there are no moral boundaries he wouldn't cross.
There were a few times when Clegane showed visible signs of hating Joffrey, such as when he orders Sansa Stark to be stripped and beaten by Ser Meryn Trant. The Hound was the first to offer Sansa a cloak to cover herself with. His affection for Sansa is also demonstrated at the Battle of Blackwater when he offers to take her back to Winterfell, which she declines. He also seems intent on lecturing her about killers such as Joffrey, Tywin, and even her brother Robb Stark, trying bluntly to inform her about how brutal the world really is. This was not the only time he showed something that bordered on compassion: he was brave enough, during the Hand's Tourney, to stop Gregor Clegane (A man he hates beyond any calculation) from butchering Loras Tyrell.
Despite having initially a captor-prisoner relationship. Sandor becomes protective and even trusting of Arya. During their journey to the Eyrie, Sandor slowly opens up to Arya, and tells her how his own brother burned half of his face. He tells her that the worst part wasn't the actual pain, but the betrayal that his own brother did it, and that his own father covered it up by telling everyone that Sandor was burned by some bedding that caught fire. He points out that while Arya thinks she's alone because most of her family is dead or missing, he is even more alone, because at least while Arya's parents were alive they cared about her, unlike his own family. When the pair meet Brienne of Tarth he immediately becomes aggressive and protective of Arya even saying that he is the one who watches over her, implying a significant bond has grown between them, this is reflected later on when Arya tells the Waif that she had taken him off of her list.
After his near death experience Sandor becomes more reflective of his actions and many of Septon Ray's teachings resonate with him, helping him to develop an aversion to unnecessary violence and a desire to live in a peaceful, contributory manner. This is partly due to his recent near death experience and partly do to Ray's dark past where he committed heinous crimes at the wishes of others, similar to Sandor during his service with the Lannisters. However, he is still fully willing to fight when the need arises, disagreeing with Ray's notion of not taking up arms for whatever reasons. This is further proven after Ray's murder, where Sandor sought to avenge his slain friend immediately until he meets up with Thoros and Beric.","1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7","",Alive,"",Clegane's Keep,"Brotherhood Without Banners, House Clegane, House Baratheon of King's Landing",Andal,"","","","","","","",Gregor Clegane,"",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1e/Sandor_s6_No_One_infobox.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160808021013,Sandor Clegane,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/37/Young_Sandor.png,Sandor's first kill.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/31/Sandor_1x01.png,Sandor arrives in Winterfell fully armored.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d2/Sandor_champion_1x05.png,Loras proclaims Sandor the Champion.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b8/Sendorsansa.png,Sandor offers advice to Sansa.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4a/Sansa_and_the_hound.jpg,Sansa talking to Sandor.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a0/Joffrey_terrified_2x09.jpg,"Sandor Clegane on the walls of the Red Keep in ""Blackwater"".",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1a/Sandor_with_Sansa_2x09.jpg,Sandor during the battle of Blackwater.,House Baratheon of King's Landing

Janos Slynt,"Lord Janos Slynt is a recurring character in the first, second, fourth and fifth seasons. He is played by guest star Dominic Carter and debuts in ""Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things."" Janos Slynt is the commander of the City Watch in King's Landing and founder of House Slynt.","Janos Slynt is the commander of the King's Landing City Watch (also called the ""Gold Cloaks""), with almost two thousand men under his command. He is charged with keeping peace and order in the city and quelling unrest.","Janos Slynt was a disgraceful, arrogant and corrupt man who would committ any action given to him by the king or queen, without hesitation, without remorse and without honour. While he claims to be a loyal and faithful servant of the Kingsguard and his main priority would be to defend the city and the king; Janos' true drive appears to be to obtain power through political positions and abuse such power to dominate his command over others by the use of immoral and cruel means, and later defend such actions by stating they were justified in the name of the king or otherwise. Amongst other things he accepts solicited bribes from criminals and other members of the City Watch.
Janos naturally enjoys authoritative positions, having found himself in them his entire life, including Lord Commander of the City Watch, member of the Small Council, head of House Slynt and an unspecified high-ranking position in the Night's Watch. However this is more of a compliment to his ability to squirm his way into the favour of other people with high-ranking positions by blind obedience and being outwardly sycophantic rather than his own accommodations.
Janos is not above treachery or hypocrisy at times. He would never have risked his position by doing the honourable thing and helping Eddard Stark remove Joffrey Baratheon from power, instead he betrays Eddard and his men on the spot and defends this to Tyrion Lannister by saying he was a traitor who attempted to buy him off, ignoring that he was already bought off by Petyr Baelish in the first place. A common mistake Janos usually makes is believing himself an important or valued necessity, whilst he is usually disregarded altogether. When being exiled to the Night's Watch, he proclaims he has ""powerful friends"" who would be upset about this but in reality no one appeared concerned over Janos' exile. He uses this excuse again when about to be executed, unaware that Tywin Lannister was dead and he was making empty threats. Finally, when Jon Snow gives the order of Janos' executions, he stands staunchly as Alliser Thorne seemingly defends him, only to be shocked when Thorne moves aside and lets them have their way with him.
Beneath his confident and defiant exterior, Janos is actually a coward. While other Lord Commanders of the City Watch are either knights or have some knowledge of the battlefield, he possesses none of the sort and prefers attacking those who cannot fight back, including Lord Eddard's defenseless soldiers in the Throne Room and Barra, one of Robert's bastards who was only a baby. His cowardice is displayed during the Battle of Castle Black where he hides with the women and children and, when finally realising Jon was serious about executing him, breaks down in tears, begging and claiming ""I've always been afraid"".","1, 2, 4, 5","Lord of Harrenhal (formerly) , Lord Commander of the City Watch (formerly)",Deceased,Beheaded for insubordination by Lord Commander Jon Snow,King's Landing,"House Baratheon of King's Landing, House Slynt, Night's Watch","","","","Petyr Baelish (Lord of Harrenhal), Bronn (Commander of the City Watch of King's Landing)","","","","","","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/ce/S4_Slynt_HD.png/revision/latest?cb=20151006235041,Janos Slynt,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/36/JanosSlynt.jpg,"Slynt commanding the City Watch in the throne room in ""You Win or You Die"".",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c3/JanosSlynt.png,"Janos Slynt about to kill the baby Barra in ""The North Remembers"".",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3b/Janos_2x02.jpg,Lord Janos is told of his fate.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7c/Aemon_part_of_jon_s_judging.jpg,Janos during Jon Snow's judging.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/99/Janos_before_execution.jpg,Janos right before he is executed by Jon Snow.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/79/Small_justice_for_Ned.png,Small justice for Ned Stark.,"","",House Baratheon of King's Landing

Tywin Lannister,"Lord Tywin Lannister is a major character in the second, third and fourth seasons. He initially appeared as a recurring character in the first season, debuting in ""You Win or You Die"", and appeared briefly as a corpse in the fifth season. He was played by starring cast member Charles Dance. Tywin Lannister was the head of House Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, Hand of the King for three different kings, and Protector of the Realm. He is the father of Cersei, Jaime and Tyrion Lannister, and sole grandfather of the incest-born Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen Baratheon.","Tywin is the Lord of House Lannister, the Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, and the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Lannister rule the region from their seat of Casterly Rock and Tywin also holds the title Lord of Casterly Rock. He is also the Warden of the West. He is a widower with three children, Jaime, Cersei and Tyrion.​ Casterly Rock, the Lannisters' ancestral seat of power, is located over a group of highly productive goldmines, which have provided the Lannisters with immense wealth over the years and led to the speculation that Tywin ""shits gold.""
Tywin is the beloved son of Tytos Lannister. His father presided over a period of decline for the house, frittering away much of their fortune on poor investments and allowing himself to be mocked at court, creating a perception of weakness. Their vassals House Reyne of Castamere rebelled against Lord Tytos, and Tywin put down the rebellion personally, extinguishing their house and re-establishing the fearsome reputation of House Lannister. His ruthless destruction of House Reyne was immortalized in the song ""The Rains of Castamere"" and gave darker meaning to the common phrase ""A Lannister always pays his debts,"" which originally referred solely to the Lannisters' vast fortune.
Tywin married his cousin Joanna Lannister and their first children were the fraternal twins Cersei and Jaime. She died after giving birth to Tyrion, which Tywin has blamed his son for ever since. When Jaime was diagnosed with a learning difficulty by a Maester who predicted that he would never read, Tywin sat with his son for four hours a day until he overcame his problems with transposing letters in his mind, much to Jaime's resentment. Tywin despises and hates his younger son, seeing him as misshapen and perverse. When Tyrion was very young, Jaime set him up with a whore. Jaime posed her as a common girl in distress that they rescued from bandits. Jaime chased the bandits off while Tyrion comforted the girl. They married, but when Tywin found out he was furious and made Jaime reveal the truth. Tywin paid her for every one of his guards to have sex with her and forced Tyrion to watch. Tyrion's hatred of Tywin has been reciprocated since. Nevertheless, all of Tywin's children are in awe of him and heed his counsel. He also took part in the War of the Ninepenny Kings.
Tywin served as Hand of the King to Aerys II Targaryen for twenty years until the Mad King, driven by envy and distrust, rejected Tywin's proposal to marry his daughter Cersei to Prince Rhaegar and made his son Jaime a member of the Kingsguard. As members of the Kingsguard are forbidden to marry, Aerys had effectively robbed Tywin of his heir, which Tywin perceived as a great insult and resigned. During Robert's Rebellion Tywin remained neutral, answering neither the summons of the King nor the calls from the rebels, until the Battle of the Trident, after which it became clear that the rebels would win. Tywin marched with the full power of Casterly Rock to the capital, feigning that he had come to defend it from the rebellion. Aerys' advisors urged the King not to trust Tywin, even Jaime Lannister, who knew his father would never back the losing side in a war.
Nevertheless, on Pycelle's advice, the gates were opened to the Lannister army. Tywin ordered the city to be taken and the royal family eliminated in a quick and efficient manner; as a result the city was sacked and the royal family massacred by Ser Gregor Clegane. Upon seeing Tywin's betrayal, Aerys ordered Jaime to bring him Tywin's head and instructed his royal pyromancer to set King's Landing ablaze. Jaime responded by personally stabbing the Mad King in the back. When Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark reached the Red Keep, Tywin presented the bodies of the royal family as proof of his allegiance. After the rebellion Robert Baratheon took the throne and married Tywin's daughter Cersei to cement the alliance between their houses.
Cersei gave birth to three children--Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen Baratheon. Unbeknownst to Tywin all three children are the product of her incestuous relationship with Jaime. This was discovered by both Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark, albeit independently, and meant that Joffrey—the oldest of the Baratheon children and the heir apparent to the Iron Throne—had no actual claim to the throne. Tywin is close to his younger brother, Kevan who is his chief advisor, and Kevan's son Lancel was King Robert's squire, and many secretly believe Lancel gave Robert too much wine during his fatal hunt on Cersei's orders.","Tywin is known for his stoic, extremely intelligent, and calculating demeanor, but also his cold, manipulative, and often unfettered attitude, even for his family. The only person he held any sentiment towards was his late wife Joanna (whom he loved dearly), having died giving birth to their son Tyrion. Since then he expressed disdain towards Tyrion for the death of his wife, as well as for shaming Tywin and their family by being born a misshapen dwarf.
Tywin insists that all he does is for the sake of his family. Tywin's own father Tytos was a generous and caring man, whose bad investments and indecision made House Lannister a laughingstock. As a result, despite admitting to Arya Stark that Tytos was ""a good man"", Tywin viewed his father's kindness as a source of weakness. Tywin successfully rebuilt his family's fortunes almost singlehandedly, and this along with his total destruction of the rebellious House Reyne caused him to embrace ruthlessness as a principal of keeping one's family in power. This ruthlessness, combined with his efficient, intelligent nature, caused the Mad King to appoint Tywin as his Hand, though Tywin later resigned due to insults by Aerys against his family.
Ironically, Tywin's harsh actions and unwillingness to serve as a caring father figure have resulted in severe emotional problems in all three of his children, who are all terrified of him. Jaime and Cersei have been having an incestuous sexual relationship since they were very young, partially due to the lack of any loving parental relationship either of them had. Tywin actually spent most of their lives away in King's Landing serving as Hand of the King, and with their mother dead, his children were functionally raised by servants. Tywin only sporadically visited his home at Casterly Rock, and on the occasions when he did return he would deal out severe punishment for any transgressions his children committed while he was away.
What little relationship Tywin may have had with Tyrion was destroyed when Tywin had his marriage to the commoner Tysha annulled, then forced Tyrion to watch as he had his guards gang-rape the girl. Tywin wanted to force all of his children into marriage-alliances to benefit House Lannister (as Cersei was later married off to King Robert), and he was offended that Tyrion risked such a future marriage alliance for himself by marrying a commoner for love. The hypocrisy in this is that Tywin himself married for love when he married his own first cousin Joanna, instead of entering into a marriage-alliance with another more powerful noble family. Over the years, Tywin seemed to develop an outright joy in inflicting petty humiliations on Tyrion, such as ""rewarding"" him on his sixteenth nameday by putting him in charge of the privys and sewers at Casterly Rock. Yet despite all this, Tywin is fully aware that Tyrion is the most intelligent and politically cunning of all of his children. Though this has driven him to despise Tyrion more, given that Tyrion is his least favorite son as well as his most valuable, Tywin has occasionally recognized Tyrion's intelligence by naming him acting Hand of the King and later Master of Coin, and betrothing him to Sansa Stark, all for the benefit of the family. When Tyrion is accused of murdering Joffrey, Tywin's reaction appears to show that he is not entirely convinced of Tyrion's guilt, knowing that Tyrion is much too smart to commit regicide in such an obvious manner, but rather than attempt to prove his son's innocence, he uses the opportunity to rid himself of Tyrion once and for all, either by execution or sending him to the Night's Watch. Though he seems to prefer the latter so as to avoid being branded a kinslayer, it is later implied that this was also part of a plan to push Jaime into renouncing his Kingsguard vows and taking his place as Tywin's heir in return for Tyrion's life.
Meanwhile, Tywin possesses a very conservative, patrician set of social values, in which women are suited to securing marriage-alliances and little else, not wielding power on their own. Thus in contrast to House Tyrell, in which female members of the family are trained in ruling and court intrigue as much as the men are, Tywin never trained Cersei how to rule. Without instruction from her father, because Tywin always disregarded her as simply a means to an end, Cersei turned into a queen who actually isn't very skilled at the art of ruling but who based her reign on her personal vendettas with Tyrion and Margaery. However, on one occasion Tywin outright stated to her that he distrusted her not because of her gender, but because she was not as smart as she thought herself to be. This assessment appears quite accurate, as Cersei's attempts to increase her power following Tywin's death simply left her more and more isolated and despised by the people of Westeros.
Of his three children Tywin has the least shame for Jaime, but not outright respect. Tywin feels disappointed that Jaime wants to continue to be a member of the Kingsguard, as while it is the highest honor a knight can aspire to, it means that Jaime had to swear away his rights to marriage or inheritance, which would leave Tywin's hated son Tyrion as his heir.
Tywin does have a generally good relationship with his younger brother Kevan, whom he shaped his whole life to serve as his faithful lieutenant. On the whole, however, for a man who claims to value family above all else, Tywin has hypocritically destroyed his relationships with his own children.
Tywin is also shown to have no regard for his grandson Joffrey, knowing fully well that he is incompetent at ruling the Realm. He was shown as having no qualms with putting Joffrey in his place when necessary, normally being cold and blunt with the boy and exerting authority over him when need be. At Joffrey's funeral, Tywin openly tells his grandson Tommen that Joffrey was not a good king much to the chagrin of Cersei.
Tywin lacks, or at least overtly lacks, the sadistic and bloodthirsty nature of his grandson Joffrey. Tywin is intelligent enough to weigh political reality against a desire for personal, petty revenge. When Tywin arrived at Lannister-occupied Harrenhal, he put a stop to the pointless torture of captured smallfolk, simply because it would be a more efficient use of resources to put them to work. In contrast, during the Sack of King's Landing he allowed his army to pillage and rape throughout the city, devastating its inhabitants. Underneath his calm exterior, Tywin can be seen to take personal satisfaction in crushing anyone who openly humiliates him (Tyrion, House Reyne of Castamere, Robb Stark, Aerys Targaryen etc.) though he only seeks this kind of vengeance when it is practical for House Lannister. Tywin treated his plans for the Red Wedding as a necessity of ending the war against the North, and he had the Stark family sword, Ice, melted down because it was made out of irreplaceable Valyrian steel which could be used to make other weapons. Privately, however, he bore a look of satisfaction as he personally threw Ice's wolf-pelt scabbard into a fire, symbolizing his destruction of House Stark in the same way he had destroyed the Reynes when they humiliated his family.
Despite his ruthless and calculating nature, Tywin is shown to have a good side if he is impressed with someone, demonstrated when he treats his young cupbearer (unaware that she is Arya Stark) with respect and kindness when she displays knowledge and the ability to read, speaks openly with her and even allows her to eat his dinner when he is not hungry and treat herself to whatever she likes in the kitchen (though considering an earlier ""assassination"" attempt on him, Tywin was probably also being cautious about poisoned food). He also demonstrates this constructive side with his grandson Tommen, whom he knows will become a much better and wiser king than Joffrey, and shares his knowledge and wisdom concerning the duties of a king.
Tywin is also much more diplomatic than Cersei or Joffrey, as while he doesn't trust any of the Great Houses apart from his own, he recognizes it as necessary to make some concessions to House Tyrell and House Martell in order to keep their valuable support. Following Tywin's death, Cersei spurns the Martells and re-ignites her previous rivalry with Margaery Tyrell, severely damaging both alliances and undoing Tywin's careful work in securing House Lannister.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5","Lord of Casterly Rock, Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, Warden of the West, Shield of Lannisport, Hand of the King (to Aerys II, Joffrey I and Tommen I), Protector of the Realm (for Tommen I), Savior of the City (for King's Landing)",Deceased,Shot in the stomach and heart by his own son Tyrion with a crossbow,Casterly Rock,House Lannister,Andal,"","Tytos Lannister (Lord Paramount of the Westerlands), Tyrion Lannister (Hand of the King to Joffrey I)","Cersei Lannister (Lady Paramount of the Westerlands), Jon Connington (Hand of the King to Aerys II), Kevan Lannister (Hand of the King to Tommen I)",Tytos Lannister,"",Joanna Lannister,"Cersei Lannister, Jaime Lannister, Tyrion Lannister",Kevan Lannister,Shae,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/71/Tywin_Lannister_4x08.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161215024806,Tywin Lannister,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1c/Castamere.png,Tywin's famous defeat of House Reyne,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a0/Tywin_and_Aerys.jpg,Tywin serves as the Mad King's Hand.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/8f/Tywin_and_Jaime_Win_or_you_Die_s1.jpg,Tywin Lannister confers with his son Jaime Lannister.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/78/Tywin_1x08.png,Tywin in the Lannister war camp,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4d/Tywinfullarmor.jpg,Tywin in full armor following the Battle of the Green Fork.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/89/TywinLannisterCP.png,Lord Tywin arrives at Harrenhal,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/de/War_council.jpg,Tywin hosts a war council at Harrenhal.,House Lannister

Her mother was a peasant.
Even more than her sisters, Obara inherited her father's martial prowess, particularly his skill with a spear. She is a very tough warrior and the most overtly martial of the Sand Snakes. The other Sand Snakes will change out of their light leather armor when traveling in the hot deserts of Dorne, but Obara always wears her leather armor. She also tends to dress in a more masculine style than her sisters, even when not in combat; her robes greatly resemble the ones her father wore. When she sees an obstacle, she does not attempt to undermine it with deception or intrigue, but will attack it head-on, relying on her skill and the strength of her weapons. This is in contrast with her sister Nymeria, who prefers to hold off and analyze her foes to calculate a more efficient means of defeating them.
Obara is the Sand Snake most like their father. He taught her the ways of war himself, training her in the use of a traditional Dornish spear like he used. Unlike most Dornishmen, who are overtly passionate, Obara is staunchly disciplined to not overtly display her emotions. This is largely due to her origins: unlike her sisters Nymeria and Tyene, Obara's mother was not a noblewoman, so when Oberyn came to take her to court, she had to choose between staying or going, the latter meaning she would never see her mother again. As a result, she has a cold and hardened demeanor, though she deeply loves her family. This is not to say that Obara is the most rational of the sisters (Nymeria is the most rational and calculating one). She is actually quite irrational and ruled by her emotions, she just doesn't outwardly show them that much. The difference is that in a situation where Tyene would aggressively shout insults at an enemy and attack them, Obara would just silently walk straight up to them and stab them without saying a word. Nymeria, in contrast, would hold back and attempt to assess if there would be a more opportune moment to strike at a later time.
Obara is loosely the lead Sand Snake, because she is eldest and probably the best fighter. Her sister Nymeria does nothing without her approval. Her father Oberyn and Nymeria were the only two people that Obara ever fully trusted. As her close confident, Nymeria is also the only person who can say ""no"" to Obara: while they may seem to argue at times, conversely this is because Nymeria is the only person that Obara will at least pay heed to - for anyone else, arguing with Obara is useless once she has her mind set on something. Nymeria is the only person Obara will ever take advice from (after their father's death).","Though staunchly loyal to her people and the future of Dorne, Obara is a formidable and somewhat ruthless warrior, exhibiting several traits that suggest that not only can she defeat the worthiest of opponents, but she enjoys watching them suffer for a while before finishing them off, whether or not her adversary has a chance to defend themselves. Of the Sand Snakes, Obara appears to be the least emotional, as she is frequently seen meditating or sleeping while her sisters bicker, to the point of being almost machine-like in nature.
Following the death of Oberyn (or maybe even before then), Obara becomes a vengeful person and willingly goes along with Ellaria Sand's plot to kill Myrcella Baratheon and plunge Dorne into war with the Lannisters, completely ignoring the fact that Myrcella is an innocent girl who had nothing to do with Oberyn's death, and that thousands of people will die as a result of these actions (though it is mentioned that the Dornish are willing to go to war for Oberyn anyway). Though Obara does not share the same evil and psychopathic traits as kinslayers such as Ramsay Bolton, she is shown to be a very dirty fighter if the situation calls for it. Her lack of emotions prevents her from objecting to Ellaria's plan to assassinate both Doran and Trystane, who are Obara's uncle and cousin by blood; instead, while ambushing Trystane, Obara and Nymeria make a joke out of it by arguing over who will kill him, and though Trystane attempts to reason with them, Obara merely laughs, and while Trystane's back is turned, she literally stabs him in the back, watching him bleed out with obvious satisfaction, indifferent to the fact that she has just committed one of the worst crimes in all of Westeros, particularly against a defenceless and innocent target. Her actions in the sixth season overall suggest that Obara is incapable of feeling love or any emotion whatsoever, given that even though it appeared that her desire was to avenge Oberyn, she insulted Oberyn's memory by murdering his brother and nephew. This hints that instead, Obara is indifferent to committing cold-blooded murder; she does it just for her own amusement, such as with the merchant captain, Myrcella and Trystane.","5, 6","",Alive,"","","Sand Snakes, Ellaria Sand, House Martell",Dornishmen,"","","",Oberyn Martell,"","","","Paternal half-sisters:, Nymeria Sand, Tyene Sand, Sarella Sand, Elia Sand, Obella Sand, Dorea Sand, Loreza Sand","",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7b/Obaras6.png/revision/latest?cb=20160531044948,Obara Sand,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1b/The_Sons_of_the_Harpy_07.jpg,"Obara about to kill the merchant captain from Planky Town, who tried to sell her the information that Jaime Lannister arrived in Dorne.",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/da/Doran%2C_Ellaria%2C_Areo_%26_Sand_Snakes.png,Obara watches as Ellaria swear fealty to her uncle.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c4/510_Martells_assembled.jpg,"Obara bids farewell to Jaime, Myrcella and Trystane.",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f7/Nym_and_Obara-601.png,Obara and Nymeria Sand confront Trystane.,"","","","","","",House Martell
Harren Hoare,"Harren Hoare, better known as Harren the Black and Black Harren, is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. He is dead by the time of the series and has only been mentioned in dialogue.","Harren the Black was an ironborn King who ruled over the Iron Islands and the Riverlands from his castle, Harrenhal. Harrenhal was the biggest castle in the entire history of the Seven Kingdoms and was built to be invulnerable to any attack by land.
However, when Aegon Targaryen invaded the Seven Kingdoms, King Harren's vassals from the Riverlands, led by Edmyn Tully, revolted against him, while Aegon the Conqueror unleashed his dragon, Balerion the Black Dread against the massive stronghold. The King of the Iron Isles and the Riverlands and his sons perished as dragonflame consumed Harrenhal, leaving behind blackened and melted ruins.

Stannis Baratheon,"King Stannis I Baratheon is a major character in the second, third, fourth and fifth seasons. He is played by starring cast member Stephen Dillane, and debuts in ""The North Remembers"". Stannis is mentioned in the first season but did not appear. He is the Lord of Dragonstone, the younger brother of King Robert Baratheon and older brother of Renly Baratheon.
Following Robert's death and the revelation that Robert's heir, Joffrey, is actually Queen Cersei's bastard son with her twin brother Jaime, Stannis declares himself the rightful King and begins a campaign to take the Iron Throne from the Lannisters. After amassing an army, Stannis attacks King's Landing and almost breaches the city, but is defeated by combined Lannister-Tyrell reinforcements and forced to retreat to Dragonstone. While planning his next move following the deaths of Joffrey and Robb Stark, Stannis travels North to the Wall to aid the Night's Watch against a wildling invasion and meets Jon Snow, attempting to acquire his help in retaking the North from House Bolton, who previously betrayed House Stark and murdered Robb. Stannis ultimately marches on Winterfell alone, but the weather slows his progress and he and his army are smashed by Bolton forces in the ensuing battle. In the aftermath, he is found and killed by Brienne of Tarth for his role in Renly's death.","Stannis is the second-born son of Steffon Baratheon and Cassana Baratheon, the younger brother of the late King Robert Baratheon and older brother of Renly Baratheon. Steffon was the head of House Baratheon and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. The Stormlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Baratheon is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Steffon died when the boys were young and Robert inherited his titles. Stannis is a serious and severe man.
Robert led a rebellion against King Aerys II Targaryen, deposing and replacing him as the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Stannis fought for Robert during the war. He was besieged at Storm's End for much of the conflict. He was rescued from starvation by the smuggler Davos, who brought a ship full of onions into the castle. Stannis knighted Davos as a reward but also punished him for his smuggling by cutting four finger tips from his right hand. Davos is fiercely loyal to Stannis and saw his punishment as just. Davos's son Matthos served Stannis as a scribe. Stannis went on to conquer Dragonstone, the seat of House Targaryen. During the Greyjoy Rebellion, Stannis destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
Stannis and Robert never loved one another. Despite Stannis's service during the war, Robert made their infant brother Renly (who was too young to have fought in the war) Lord of Storm's End following his victory, which Stannis took as an affront. Stannis was made Lord of Dragonstone and served on his brother's small council as Master of Ships. Though not outright cruel or malicious, he is a stern and humorless man, making him the least popular of the Baratheon brothers.
He married Selyse Florent. They have a loveless marriage; Stannis regards her as sickly and resents her failure to bear him a son. During the first season Stannis is on Dragonstone for an extended stay, preferring the solitude of the island.
He has converted to the Lord of Light under the influence of the priestess Melisandre. His household have largely followed his conversion. He has adopted the flaming red heart of the Lord of Light with the stag of Baratheon in the middle as his sigil.","Stannis was a cold, cruel, hard, firm, and rarely-forgiving man but also brave and in possession of an immense sense of duty. As is expected of Baratheons, Stannis was proven on the battlefield as both a commander of men and warrior, as he had a keen mind for strategy and warfare that led him to be respected by many high-lords and was also fearless in combat, where he could battle and defeat other soldiers even injured or without armour. Unlike his brothers, Stannis was in better control of his emotions in comparison to the temperamental Robert and youthful Renly, whereas he always appeared calculating and stoic, repressing his emotions and desires for most of his life for the sole objections of the greater good. Even when fully prepared to vent his emotions, he is able to retain his composure and dignity, even when he is about to be executed. Stannis has extremely little patience for false politeness that is expected of a lord in court and generally states his opinions of others or what is on his mind aloud. Because of this he does not surround himself with sycophants as Cersei does but with advisors whom he trusts to be blunt with the truth, whether he may object to it or not.
Stannis has an unbreakable code of honor and sense of duty and justice which he is rather controlled by. After learning that Robert's children were all bred of incest and had no actual entitlement to the Iron Throne, he began viewing it as his right and destiny to be king, but despite his ambitions, Stannis did not appear (or externally appear) megalomaniacal. as he admits to Davos Seaworth that although he did not ask to king, by every rightful law he is and had to accept his duty whether he liked it or not. Stannis, while fundamentally viewed as a good, or at the very least, decent man could easily be swayed due to his religious faith and obsession with fulfilling the prophecy of Azor Ahai which could turn him rather ruthless, where he regrettably burnt his daughter living.
Stannis is also not as popular with the smallfolk as his two brothers are. Robert, although a poor ruler was at least respected as a warrior and Renly was the most well-liked of the Baratheons. Stannis, meanwhile, is neither lacking both the charisma and handsomeness that is found within his family. Due to his cold and blunt nature, he inspires little loyalty or love from his men and he does not seem to care about his unpopularity nor does he seek the respect or admiration of the people but has faith that his men will follow him and die for him anyway because of his birthright. Stannis is also reliant on fear to keep his men in check and considers public displays of kindness a weakness leaders should not possess. On the other hand, Stannis's advisor, Davos Seaworth has complete loyalty, admiration and respect for Stannis and encourages his claim completely despite being drastically punished by him in the past, implying some degree of bravado on his part.
Ever since encountering Lady Melisandre and welcoming her into his inner council, he has accepted her religion in The Lord of Light completely and also her beliefs that he is The Prince That Was Promised, a messiah figure within the faith of R'hllor. Stannis, after converting to The Lord of Light has employed the use of blood magic to secure his claim to the throne such as human sacrifices and burning leeches. Stannis is also quite proud of his faith as he uses the symbol of R'hllor, a burning heart as the banner for his house, modified with the stag head of House Baratheon in the middle.
Stannis is not completely without a good side if he is impressed with someone nor is he above making personal friends. He did love his daughter, Shireen, defending her from his wife, Selyse who hated her since birth due to not being a male heir and refusing to kill her because of her Greyscale. He also made a friend of Davos Seaworth, one of his most trusted advisors and this was reciprocated fully with Davos pledging his loyalty and life to Stannis. He even planned to name him Hand of the King after he took the Iron Throne and comforted him over his sons death despite imprisoning him as a traitor at the time. He was obviously impressed with Jon Snow and, unlike many people in the Night's Watch, treated the bastard seriously presumably out of respect for his father, Eddard Stark who made him aware of Joffrey, Tommen and Myrcella's parentage and was prepared to legitimise him as Jon Stark, making him the official Lord of Winterfell if he agreed to help his cause. Robert and Stannis were in a loveless brotherhood, which they admit to each other. This was also the same with Renly, however they appear on slightly better terms than with Robert. During negotiations he welcomed Renly to a place in his small council and (until he fathered a male heir) was prepared to allow him be heir to his throne if he lay down his forces. He also showed remorse over indirectly killing his little brother and he doesn't attempt to lie to Brienne of Tarth, Renly's Kingsguard, over his involvement.
Despite his accomplishments and supreme tactics, Stannis was extremely stubborn. He refused to ask Robb Stark or his brother to his assist his army, ignoring that Robb and his goals could help each other, claiming he stole The North from his kingdom. Stannis equates this with everything, viewing everyone who does not support his claim as foes and lords of different parts of the Seven Kingdoms without his say-so as usurpers. The prime example of Stannis's rigidness is what caused his demise. Ignoring the loss of half his forces and Melisnadre abandoning him, he continues his siege on Winterfell anyway and is quickly destroyed by Ramsay Bolton's forces. With his faith broken, his ambition quashed and his family destroyed, Stannis does not attempt to avoid his fate and calmly accepts his execution.","2, 3, 4, 5","King of the Andals and the First Men (claimant), Lord of the Seven Kingdoms (claimant), Protector of the Realm (claimant), Lord of Dragonstone, Lord of Storm's End, Lord Paramount of the Stormlands, Master of Ships (formerly; to Robert I)",Deceased,Beheaded after the Battle of Winterfell by Brienne of Tarth,Storm's End,"House Baratheon of Dragonstone, House Baratheon",Andal,"R'hllor, the Lord of Light (convert), Faith of the Seven (formerly)","",Mace Tyrell (as Master of Ships),Steffon Baratheon,Cassana Baratheon,Selyse Florent,"Shireen Baratheon, Petyr Baratheon (stillborn), Tommard Baratheon (stillborn), Edric Baratheon (stillborn)","Robert Baratheon, Renly Baratheon",Melisandre,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7a/Stannis_S05E09.png/revision/latest?cb=20161215025402,Stannis Baratheon,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7e/Stannis_Great_Wyk.png,Stannis leading the attack on Great Wyk during the Greyjoy Rebellion.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5f/StannisNorthRemember.jpg,"Stannis's first appearance in ""The North Remembers"".",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b8/Stannis_Baratheon.png,"Stannis parleys with his brother Renly Baratheon in ""Garden of Bones"".",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/39/Stannis_names_Davos_his_Hand.jpg,Stannis names Davos his Hand of the King.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3b/Stannis_landing_boats_2x09.jpg,Stannis leads his landing from the prow of a longboat.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4f/Stannis-3x01.jpg,Stannis becomes isolated and withdrawn following the Battle of the Blackwater.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/84/Stannis_visits_Davos_in_his_cell.jpg,Stannis visits Davos in his cell.,House Baratheon of Dragonstone

Davos Seaworth,"Ser Davos Seaworth, also known as the Onion Knight, is a major character in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. He is played by starring cast member Liam Cunningham and debuts in ""The North Remembers"". Davos is a landed knight, and a former smuggler who was in the service of Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone and claimant to the Iron Throne, whom he served as Hand of the King.
After Stannis's defeat and death at Winterfell, Davos remains at Castle Black, where he is caught in the midst of a mutiny among the Night's Watch that initially led to the death of Lord Commander Jon Snow. Siding with Jon's followers, Davos becomes one of his lieutenants after persuading Melisandre to resurrect Jon. He later sides with House Stark and proclaims Jon Snow the King in the North after Jon retakes Winterfell from House Bolton.","Ser Davos Seaworth is a landed knight and a reformed smuggler. His ship used to ply the Narrow Sea, smuggling goods from the Free Cities into the Seven Kingdoms and back again.
Davos was born in Flea Bottom, the poorest slum in King's Landing. His father was a poor crabber. He became a sailor while very young to escape the slums and has spent most of his life sailing the Narrow Sea. His black-sailed ship became infamous for sneaking into harbors in the dead of night while avoiding detection.
During Robert's Rebellion, Davos aided Stannis Baratheon while he was besieged in Storm's End, by delivering smuggled onions and other foodstuffs into the castle. The supplies helped Stannis' forces survive until the end of the war. For this service, Stannis rewarded Davos by bestowing him with knighthood and lands.
He chose the name ""Seaworth"" for his family's new noble House, as a reference to his smuggling past. Highborn members of older noble Houses disparagingly called Davos ""the Onion Knight"" for his actions, but he has embraced this title and proudly took an onion for a sigil and sewed it onto his ship's sails.
Stannis also cut off four finger tips from Davos' right hand as punishment for his smuggling crimes. Thieves in Westeros are often sentenced to having fingers or the whole hand removed, but Stannis only took the fingertips of his less used hand (his right, as Davos is left-handed). Davos submitted to this punishment willingly, judging it a fair exchange in return for improving his family's future prospects. He also mentions in a featurette that he submitted to the punishment for the sake of sheer justice, saying he ""avoided punishment for too long"". He wears his severed finger bones in a pouch about his neck and believes they bring him good luck.
Davos is one of Stannis's most loyal and reliable vassals and arguably his best friend, but is treated with disdain by some of the other lords of Westeros for his low birth. Stannis himself points out that it was the low-born Davos, and not the high-born lords, who saved the lives of Stannis and his castle garrison. Davos is one of the only men who can (even grudgingly) influence Stannis' decisions, because he values Davos's honest advice above that of noble-born flatterers.
Davos has several sons, including Matthos, who serves with him on his ship and is a scribe for Stannis. He is proud of his son's education but remains illiterate.
Even though Stannis's wife Selyse despises Ser Davos, their daughter Shireen is fond of him and considers him a friend.","","2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","Ser, Hand of the King (formerly; claimant; to Stannis I)",Alive,"","Gin Alley, King's Landing","House Seaworth, House Stark, House Baratheon of Dragonstone",Andal,"Faith of the Seven (raised), None (currently)","","","","",Marya Seaworth,Matthos Seaworth,"","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/99/Davos_Seaworth_season_6_episode_10_preview.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160627155014,Davos Seaworth,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e0/Davos_History_and_Lore.png,A young Davos in Flea Bottom.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/6c/Davos_storm%27s_end.png,Davos' rescue of Storm's End.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/99/Painted_Table_Dragon_motif_2x01.jpg,Davos sits at the Painted Table with Stannis and Melisandre.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0f/Davos_and_Salladhor_at_Dragonstone.jpg,Davos walks with Salladhor on the shore of Dragonstone.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4f/Stannis_and_Davos.jpg,Stannis and Davos walk through his camp.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4c/Davos_warns_Stannis.jpg,Davos counsels Stannis.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b2/Davos_flying_like_a_bird.jpg,Davos is flung as the wildfire pulverizes his ship.,House Stark

He served as the first Hand of the King to Robert Baratheon.","Jon Arryn was the Lord of the Eyrie and the head of House Arryn, one of the Great Houses of Westeros. Jon was the Warden of the East and Defender of the Vale. He was a respected nobleman and both Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon were fostered by him during their adolescence. The Mad King condoned the alleged kidnapping of Eddard's sister, Lyanna, who was also Robert's betrothed, and demanded that Eddard and Robert, still in the Vale, be turned over to the King's justice. Instead, Lord Arryn rebelled, calling his banners to war. House Stark and House Baratheon followed suit. The rebels forged an alliance with House Tully through marriage, with Eddard married to Catelyn Tully and the then-elderly Jon to the young Lysa Tully. After the rebel victory in the war, Robert became King and appointed Jon as his Hand. Jon served the realm well for many years as Hand of the King. Indeed, Jon Arryn was essentially the man really holding the realm together for the next seventeen years, while Robert drank, ate and whored his way through his reign.
Jon Arryn died in King's Landing immediately prior to the events of the series, sparking King Robert's search for a replacement.

She was also the mother of four of Oberyn's infamous eight bastard daughters, all of whom he has acknowledged and given his love and care. He named the fifth one, Elia Sand, after his late sister.
When he was a teenager, Oberyn was accompianed by his big sister Elia on a visit to Casterly Rock. While there, Oberyn and Elia were eager to see the ""monster"" that had just been born. Cersei finally showed them Tyrion, but the Martell siblings were somewhat disappointed to see that he was just a baby, and somewhat disturbed by Cersei's already strong hatred of him.
Prince Oberyn trained at the Citadel in his youth, in order to become a maester. Although he ultimately grew bored and abandoned his studies, he managed to forge several links in a maester's chain, and became well versed in the use of poisons in the process. When he was sixteen, an older nobleman caught Oberyn in bed with his mistress and challenged Oberyn to a duel to first blood; Oberyn won the duel, and several days later the man died from festering wounds, likely because Oberyn had poisoned his blade. Oberyn also travelled to Essos in his youth; for a time, he served in the mercenary company known as the Second Sons. He once went to the city of Astapor there and saw the Unsullied, whom he jokingly remarked were impressive on the battlefield, but less so in the bedroom. He lived in Essos for a total of five years. It is implied that Oberyn fought duels in the infamous fighting pits of Meereen, as he mentions to Tyrion that he learned some of his combat techniques ""during his years in the fighting pits"".
Despite his wayward ways and liberal attitude towards sexuality, Oberyn was very devoted to his family, telling his lover Ellaria that any other person would always have to wait behind her for his affection. He was very close with his sister, Elia, and took her death very hard. As a result, he had a strong and fierce hatred for House Lannister, especially towards Tywin Lannister, whom he believed ordered his sister's murder. He was also close to his older brother, Doran, despite their very different personalities.","Oberyn Martell was a forceful, lusty man with a quick wit and barbed tongue. He was renowned for his duels, his temper, his keen intellect, and his carnality, all of which made him extremely popular in Dorne. Oberyn traveled the world in his youth, and even fought in a mercenary company in Essos - his skill with a spear was enough to face off evenly against the feared Gregor Clegane in a duel. He had a very close relationship with his sister Elia and they were inseparable as children. Oberyn was also close to his older brother Doran, although their temperaments were very different. While Doran had been raised to be the heir to the Dornish throne, Oberyn was able to indulge in the wayward ways common among the Dornishmen.
Oberyn was also a very intelligent man: he studied at the Citadel for several years before deciding he was simply bored with a future as a maester and left. During that time he studied poisons extensively, which he frequently coated his weapons with. He was also able to recognize that substantially heavy armor would hinder his proficiency in combat, since he preferred unpredictability and agility over strength.
Above all Oberyn was a deeply passionate man, with a hot temper that often leads him into duels and grudges, but in equal measure this also made him deeply loyal to those he cares about, such as his siblings, his paramour Ellaria, and his daughters. Although he was a very serious man, he had a very laid-back, easygoing attitude, taking anything that came his way in his stride, but he wasn't incapable of being deadly serious when the situation insisted upon it.
Oberyn's overall attitude was that life is short, and one must enjoy all of life's pleasures while one can - thus his sexual adventures had become infamous, and popular rumor has it that he must have had sex with half of the people he had ever met on both sides of the Narrow Sea. He was also pansexual and did not limit his pleasure to one gender alone, thus he engaged in sex with both men and women. Despite his promiscuity, he genuinely loved his paramour, Ellaria, who is equally wild as Oberyn was. Oberyn was a deeply honorable man, but his philosophy in life was that he didn't care about the negative opinions of others - he would rather live life on his own terms, openly challenging his enemies and risk destruction rather than live by someone else's rules.
Rather ironically, it was Oberyn's zest for life, his temper, overconfidence, love for his sister, and hatred towards Gregor Clegane that led to his death. He entered his duel with Gregor with an arrogant swagger, making already several impetuous and unwise decisions such as drinking before the duel and refusing to wear a helmet. Moreover, he was clearly enjoying himself while fighting Gregor, even though he was aware of the seriousness of the situation and one false move could result in both his and an innocent man's death. Given the skills he displayed while fighting The Mountain, however perhaps these traits were not unjustified. Unfortunately near the end of their fight where it seems certain Oberyn would win he allows his emotions to get the better of him, angrily demanding a confession to killing his sister which Gregor uses as an advantage and brutally kills him but not before sadistically admitting to murdering Elia and her children and raping her.",4,Prince,Deceased,Skull crushed by Ser Gregor Clegane during the Second Trial by Combat of Tyrion Lannister,Sunspear,"House Martell, Citadel",Dornishmen,Faith of the Seven,"","","","","","Obara Sand, Nymeria Sand, Tyene Sand, Sarella Sand, Elia Sand, Obella Sand, Dorea Sand, Loreza Sand","Doran Martell, Elia Martell",Ellaria Sand (paramour),http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/96/Oberyn-Martell-house-martell-37118334-2832-4256.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150815065729,Oberyn Martell,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3a/Young_Oberyn.png,Oberyn in his youth.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d9/Oberyn_Martell.jpg,Prince Oberyn confronts the two Lannister soldiers.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/03/Cercei_Tywin_and_Oberyn.jpg,Cersei and Tywin greet Oberyn Martell.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f4/Oberyn-and-Tywin-S4-EP-03.jpg,Oberyn confronts Tywin over his sister's murder.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b3/Oberyn_Martell_6.png,Oberyn writes a poem for his daughter Elia.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/94/Oberyn_-_The_Laws_of_Gods_and_Men.jpg,"Oberyn at the small council, complaining about the early meeting.",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3c/Oberyn_Martell_in_The_Laws_of_Gods_and_Men.jpg,Oberyn serving as one of the three judges at Tyrion's trial.,House Martell

Sandbox/Jon Snow (Updated),"King Jon Snow is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and Seventh seasons. He is played by starring cast member Kit Harington, and debuts in the series premiere.
Jon is the biological son of the late Rhaegar Targaryen and Lady Lyanna Stark, the sister of Eddard Stark. However, Eddard Stark, Jon's uncle, raised Jon as his own bastard son at Winterfell alongside his lawful children to protect Jon from Robert Baratheon, who would presumably kill him if he knew of his true parentage. Jon is also cousins with Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon Stark, who were raised as his half-siblings. Jon is also the grandson of Aerys II Targaryen, and the nephew of Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen.","Jon Snow is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. Ned never told anyone, including Jon, who his mother was - an unusual position for a bastard, as they normally know who their mother is but not their father. When Ned left for the south to fight in Robert's Rebellion, he left his pregnant new bride Lady Catelyn Tully at Riverrun while he continued on campaign, and she later gave birth to his first lawful son, Robb Stark. Ned eventually made it to the Tower of Joy and found his sister Lyanna lying in bed and covered in blood. She asked Ned to promise her that he would take care of and protect her newly born son, Jon, saying that King Robert Baratheon would kill him. She then died Ned's arms, her last words being ""Promise me, Ned. Promise me."". When Ned returned from the war, he had brought with him the infant boy, which he said was his bastard son that he fathered during the war. Ned once told Robert that he was his bastard son from a women named Wylla, but he refused to elaborate any further. Ned never even told Jon himself whether his mother was alive or dead, though he later promised that when he later returned from serving King Robert in King's Landing, he would tell Jon about her (as by then he would have reached the age of adulthood).
Acknowledged bastard children of lords are usually sent away to one of their other castles or holdings to be taken care of but not kept in the presence of his lawful family. Very unusually, Eddard announced that he would raise Jon at his home castle Winterfell, alongside his trueborn children with Catelyn. Robb was always treated as Eddard's heir, but otherwise, Jon wasn't treated much differently than his younger half-brothers Bran and Rickon. Jon's presence at Winterfell was an understandable source of friction between Eddard and his wife Catelyn. Given that Jon was never legitimized, she was never his ""stepmother"" in any sense of the term or had any obligations to him whatsoever. Instead, he was a living reminder of the one time that Eddard had dishonored her, though otherwise over the years she loved Eddard very deeply. Catelyn never mistreated Jon but she was cold to him and avoided him whenever possible (not that Jon ever said he expected more from her). Catelyn would later confess to her daughter-in-law Talisa about how Jon caught the pox when he was a child, and she, out of guilt for previously praying for his death, stayed with him through the night and prayed to the gods to let him live, finally accepting that he was not to blame for Eddard's affair with Wylla, though it was still not enough to make her love Jon, something she would later regret.
Due to his bastard status, Jon grew up feeling like an outsider at Winterfell. Eddard would see that Jon was well treated, but, for example, when King Robert and Queen Cersei made an official visit to Winterfell, Jon was not allowed to sit inside at the front table with the king and lords, as this might have offended them. Otherwise, Jon still lived better than many bastard-born children and was well-raised by Eddard as his own. He was loved by his father and siblings, was never hungry or poor, lived in his father's castle, always had a roof over his head, and received a young lord's martial training from Winterfell's Master-at-Arms, Ser Rodrik Cassel. Of his half-siblings, Jon was close friends with Robb - given that they were roughly the same age, being regular companions in training and riding. He was on good terms with both Bran and Rickon as well as having a friendly rival in Lord Eddard's ward Theon Greyjoy. However, Jon's closest relationship was with Lord Stark's younger daughter, Arya, who, as an adventurous tomboy prone to unladylike pursuits, also felt like a social outsider. In contrast, Jon's relationship with Sansa was unpleasant; very much her mother's daughter, she could be aloof and cold to him as well.","Because he was raised by Ned Stark in Winterfell, Jon has adopted a clear moral compass and a true sense of honor, which he tries his hardest to abide by even when he must make a difficult decision, especially after he became Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He has always admired and idolized his father, but due to Catelyn Stark's cold disdain for Jon, Eddard was careful not to give him more attention than his lawful children by Catelyn. Lady Stark was never actively mean to Jon, but because he wasn't her own son she intentionally ignored him (as is common for bastard children), meaning that Jon grew up without a mother-figure. Nor did Jon consider Catelyn's behavior to be unusual or unexpected: it is rare for a noble to raise their bastard child alongside their lawful children, and his presence was a great insult to her honor. While his interactions with Catelyn remained awkward or nonexistent, he actually became good friends with his half-siblings, particularly Robb and Arya. Robb was of the same age as Jon so they became playmates and comrades in training, while due to her tomboyish personality Arya was also something of a social misfit like Jon, which they bonded over.
Like many bastard children, Jon had to learn to grow up quickly. This made Jon mature and perceptive beyond his age, so he could navigate his complicated relationships within the Stark household. His bastard status has also made Jon something of a loner, solemn and somber with a desire to prove himself to society and to his father. Jon thought that the best way for a bastard in his position to gain honor and respect was to join the Night's Watch, emulating his uncle Benjen, because past social status is ignored after joining the Watch. Despite his introverted demeanor, Jon is very compassionate and protective of his fellow outcasts such as Samwell Tarly, Grenn, and Pyp.
In many ways, Jon has been unusually lucky for a bastard child, given how rare it is for a lord to raise one in his own castle alongside his lawful children. For all of Jon's misgivings about not knowing his mother and Catelyn ignoring and shunning him, he was loved by his father and siblings, was never poor or hungry, but lived in a castle and always had a roof over his head. Jon was also formally trained in swordsmanship by Ser Rodrik Cassel, and excelled at it. This made Jon somewhat arrogant when he was a new recruit at Castle Black, until Tyrion pointed out that the other recruits were all far less fortunate than he was. This humbles Jon, and he changes his behavior to be the champion of the other downtrodden recruits, and helps train them by walking them through the swordplay techniques he knows.
The Starks were an interfaith household, with Eddard and Catelyn's children being exposed to not only the religion of the Old Gods of the Forest worshiped by most Northmen, but also Catelyn's devout adherence to the Faith of the Seven. Because Jon had no real interaction with Catelyn, and revered his father Eddard, he was not exposed to the Seven but proudly keeps to the Old Gods, and honors the traditions of his First Men ancestors. When Jon took his vow to become a member of the Night's Watch, he chose to do so in front of a heart tree, sacred to the Old Gods.
Jon is also fairly shy around women, and as he revealed to Samwell, he was a virgin when he joined the Night's Watch. While he was attractive enough, as a bastard son with nothing to inherit he had no realistic marriage prospects with noblewomen. Jon was even wary of having sex with random girls or prostitutes (as Theon did), because he was terrified of fathering a bastard of his own: having lived his life as a bastard, he felt that it wasn't a life another child should have to go through.
However, death has changed Jon. Despite his honorable convictions and previous commitment to the Night's Watch, his experience being murdered by his own men and then revived has made Jon far more cynical and nihilistic. No longer believing in himself and his ability to face the coming threat, due to being murdered for doing what he thought was right - Jon abandons the Night's Watch, despite knowing full well how dangerous the threat looming beyond the Wall really is. He loses his determination about fighting and becomes much more lonely and melancholic only speaking when he hasn't any other choice. Also, Jon feels remorse for hanging his former steward Olly, even though the latter did murder both him and the woman he loved. While he is wary of conflict since his return, his love for his family has brought him back into the fight. To this end, Jon chooses his family over the Night's Watch - a choice he once attempted to make when Robb marched off to war, but forsook in the past. When Ramsay decides to play a ""game"" with Rickon, Jon once again chooses his family by attempting to save his little brother's life, even at the cost of his own life and battle plans.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","King in the North, 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch (formerly)",Alive (resurrected),"",Tower of Joy,"House Stark, House Targaryen",Northmen,Old Gods of the Forest,"","","","","","","","",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/49/Battle_of_the_Bastards_08.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160615184845,Sandbox/Jon Snow (Updated),http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/ed/Jon_baby.png,"Ned brings a newborn Jon to Winterfell, as Catelyn looks on in horror.",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/35/Jon_and_Robb.png,Jon and Robb play with snowballs in their childhood.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/43/Arya_and_Needle.jpg,"Needle, the sword that Jon gave to his half-sister Arya as a going-away present.",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f6/Winter_is_Coming_Bran_Robb_Jon.png,Jon and Robb instruct Bran.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/70/Screen_Shot_2013-06-16_at_12.18.27_AM.png,Jon finds Ghost beside the pup's dead mother.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/08/Jon_and_Sam_oaths.jpg,Jon and Sam swear their oaths to the Old Gods.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/df/Jon_and_Jeor.jpg,Lord Commander Mormont rewards Jon Snow.,House Stark

Aegon V Targaryen,"Aegon V Targaryen, also called Aegon the Unlikely, and informally known as Egg, is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. He is long dead by the time the series begins.
Aegon V was the fifth king of his name to sit on the Iron Throne and the fifteenth king of the Targaryen dynasty to rule the Seven Kingdoms. He was the father of the Mad King and his sister-wife Queen Rhaella, the grandfather of Rhaegar, Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen, the great-grandfather of Jon Snow, and the younger brother of Maester Aemon. In the books, he was dubbed ""the Unlikely"" because he was the fourth son of Maekar Targaryen, who was in turn the fourth son of Daeron II Targaryen, and thus Aegon was highly unlikely to have inherited the crown.","Unlike most of their forebears, Aegon and his brothers were not born out of marriage between brother and sister. Their father and grandfather respectively married Dyanna of House Dayne and Myriah of House Martell. Aegon was not originally expected to succeed his father to the throne, but after his older brother Aerion died, and his next older brother Aemon refused the throne due to his vows as a maester, the crown passed to him. Aemon then joined the Night's Watch to remove himself from the royal court, where he might be used as a political tool against his brother.
Starting as a child, Aegon V began an odd friendship with the hedge knight Ser Duncan the Tall. He became Duncan's squire, and they had many adventures across Westeros. Eventually, after Aegon V came to the throne he named Ser Duncan to the Kingsguard, and in time he became its Lord Commander. He later sent his army to deal with Maelys Blackfyre during the War of the Ninepenny Kings.
After ruling for many years, Aegon V ultimately died along with Ser Duncan the Tall in the Tragedy at Summerhall when he attempted to hatch new dragon eggs using fire and sorcery. Instead, it caused a fire that spread out of control and destroyed the entire palace. Aegon V died in the conflagration, and was succeeded by his son Aerys II Targaryen.","","1,4,5","King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm",Deceased,"259 AL, Perished in the Tragedy at Summerhall",Summerhall,House Targaryen,Valyrian,Faith of the Seven,Maekar I Targaryen,Aerys II Targaryen,Maekar Targaryen,Dyanna Dayne,"","Duncan Targaryen, Aerys II Targaryen, Rhaella Targaryen, Daeron Targaryen","Aerion Targaryen, Aemon Targaryen","",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/ef/Aegon_V.png/revision/latest?cb=20150302235808,Aegon V Targaryen,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/81/Dunk_and_Egg.png,Aegon riding alongside Ser Duncan the Tall in his youth.,"","","","","","","","","","","","",House Targaryen

Robb Stark,"King  Robb Stark is a major character in the first, second, and third seasons. He also appears in flashback form in the sixth season. He is played by starring cast member Richard Madden and debuts in the series premiere. Robb is the eldest son of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell and his wife, Lady Catelyn. He is the brother of Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon Stark, and cousin (believed to be half-brother) of Jon Snow. He also adopts a direwolf named Grey Wind. Robb is declared the King in the North during the War of the Five Kings.
Despite his young age, he commands great respect and is notable for never having lost a battle, earning himself the nickname ""the Young Wolf"" - after the sigil of his house. He rules the North and the Riverlands until he is murdered at the Red Wedding, alongside his pregnant wife, his mother, and many of his lords' bannermen, by Houses Frey and Bolton.","Robb was the eldest child of Lady Catelyn and Lord Eddard Stark. Eddard was the head of House Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and Lord Paramount of the North, one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms. The Starks rule the region from their seat of Winterfell. Eddard was also the Warden of the North to King Robert Baratheon. Robb was born at Riverrun and raised in Winterfell. His father left his mother the morning after their wedding to fight in Robert's Rebellion and did not return until after Robb was born. He had two younger trueborn brothers, Bran and Rickon, and two sisters, Sansa and Arya.  Robb was also close to his ""bastard half-brother"" Jon Snow, who is actually his cousin and the child of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, and to his father's ward Theon Greyjoy, whom he counted as his best friend outside of the family. He had been trained from childhood to wield a sword and wear armor by Winterfell's Master-at-Arms Ser Rodrik Cassel and was highly proficient with both for his young age. He lived at Winterfell with his family.","Robb had a keen sense of honor and justice, which he received from his father. He was fair, caring, and willing to do anything to keep his family safe. Unlike Roose Bolton, one of his central bannermen, Robb saw no reason for torture, cruelty, or unnecessary executions, and treated his prisoners of war well and justly. He did not wish for violence or war and did his best to limit the deaths and casualties on both sides. He also expended tremendous sympathies to innocent victims of war such as Martyn and Willem Lannister.
Robb had a surprisingly keen mind for warfare and strategy, a trait that takes Tywin Lannister completely by surprise, who saw Robb as a stupid child who hadn't the slightest idea of the violence of war and after his first taste of battle would ""run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs."" The Lannisters were quite surprised when Robb led a stunning surprise attack in the Battle of the Whispering Wood to crush the western half of the Lannister armies under Jaime. Tywin also did not expect Robb to have the determination to send hundreds of his own men to their deaths in a feint to the east.
Robb was very much his father's son, but this means that he has not only his father's strengths but his father's weaknesses. Like Eddard, Robb lacked proper political skills and had a tendency to put honor before reason. He married a political nobody out of love, needlessly spurning a badly needed political alliance with the Freys. Robb also put honor before pragmatic political needs when he executed Lord Rickard Karstark for treason and murder, costing him the Karstark contingent from his army. Like most Northerners, Robb was more proficient as a warrior than as a politician and court maneuverer. Much like his own father Ned Stark or Robert Baratheon, Robb Stark was an excellent warrior and military commander but a bad politician.
Roose Bolton viewed Robb as both arrogant and foolish, and Walder Frey considered Robb's title as the Young Wolf to be a show of pomposity. Despite this, Robb was a good man and he was mourned profusely by Sansa once she heard the news. Even Tyrion Lannister commented to Sansa that Robb seemed like a good man to him.","1, 2, 3","King in the North, Lord of Winterfell",Deceased,"Wounded by Frey crossbowmen, then fatally stabbed through the heart by Roose Bolton","Riverrun (birthplace), Winterfell (raised)",House Stark,Northmen,"Old Gods of the Forest, Faith of the Seven","Torrhen Stark (King in the North), Eddard Stark (Lord of Winterfell)","Jon Snow (King in the North), Roose Bolton (Lord of Winterfell)",Eddard Stark,Catelyn Stark,Talisa Maegyr,Unborn child,"Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Bran Stark, Rickon Stark, Jon Snow (paternal cousin raised as bastard half-brother)","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/50/S3E9_Robb_Stark_main.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160718071203,Robb Stark,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/00/Robb_baby.png,Robb as a baby.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/35/Jon_and_Robb.png,Robb and Jon play with snowballs in their childhood.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4b/Robb_1x01.png,Robb at the deserter's execution.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c2/Branandrobb.png,Robb saves Bran from the wildlings.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5f/The_king_in_the_north.png,Robb Stark is declared the King in the North.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d6/RobbStarkNorthRemembers.jpg,"Robb Stark in ""The North Remembers"".",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f8/GreyWindSeason2Debut.jpg,Robb confronts Jaime Lannister with Grey Wind.,House Stark

Sansa Stark,"Princess Sansa Stark is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. She is played by starring cast member Sophie Turner, and debuts in the series premiere. Sansa is the eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell and his wife Lady Catelyn, sister of Robb, Arya, Bran and Rickon Stark, and ""half-sister"" of Jon Snow. She initially starts off as a soppy, slightly petulant girl with a very naive view of the world, but as time goes on and she and her family suffer one cruelty and betrayal after another, she becomes a more hardened and learned individual.","Sansa Stark is the eldest daughter and second child of Lady Catelyn and Lord Eddard Stark. Eddard is the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rules the region from their seat of Winterfell and Eddard also holds the titles of Lord of Winterfell and the Warden of the North to King Robert Baratheon.
Sansa was born and raised at Winterfell. She has an older brother, Robb, two younger brothers, Bran and Rickon, a younger sister, Arya and a ""bastard half-brother"" Jon Snow, whom she had a distant relationship with due to her mother's influence (which, like her mother, Sansa later regretted). Sansa enjoys proper ""lady-like"" pursuits, and is good at sewing, embroidering, poetry, singing, dancing, literature and music. When she was young she dreamed of being a regal Queen like Cersei Lannister, and that just like in the epic songs she would meet her knight in shining armor. She has inherited her mother's Tully coloring, unlike most of her siblings, and Lady Catelyn thinks Sansa will be even more beautiful than she was when she was younger. She is often seen in contrast with her sister, Arya Stark who has neither her looks nor her accomplishments in feminine activities and comportment.","When she lived at Winterfell with her family, Sansa grew up as the eldest daughter of a Great House, trying to emulate her mother's example of a ""proper lady"" from the southern courts. Sansa's devotion to the traditional, refined ""feminine virtues"" caused friction between her and her blunt, tomboyish younger sister Arya, with whom she had a playful rivalry. As a little girl, Sansa naively believed in the tales and epic romances in which every princess gets her honorable knight in shining armor to sweep her off her feet. Sansa was infatuated with the traditional romances about mythical figures like Jonquil, and historical figures like Duncan, the Prince of Dragonflies. Her greatest goal in life was to be married to a heroic and handsome prince, sitting around with other noblewomen eating lemon cakes while gossiping about the goings-on at court.
Sansa's innocent infatuation with the ideals of princesses and knights - perfectly understandable for a 13-year-old girl - made her tragically susceptible to the manipulations of the Lannisters. She held the blind belief that all queens and princes are kind and truthful, as if inherently a result of their titles, when Cersei just happened to be a woman who married a king to secure a marriage alliance, and Joffrey just happened to be her son. Without real cause, she blindly loved Joffrey with all her heart, and trusted and admired Cersei, only for them to repay her love and trust by beheading her father before her very eyes.
Afterwards, Sansa has a harrowing experience as a prisoner of the Lannisters, a plaything for the psychopathic Joffrey to have publicly beaten by his guards for petty amusement. Her shock at the death of her father was only later deepened at the news of how her mother and brother Robb were horrifically killed at the Red Wedding and their corpses desecrated. She was visibly elated upon hearing that Arya, Bran, and Rickon were actually still alive, and though she took mostly after her mother and had a somewhat distant relationship with Jon, she loved him all the same. She was surprised to hear that Jon had become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and Jon was the first person for her to decide to turn to for shelter after escaping Winterfell, aware that he would protect her from Ramsay.
Sansa subsequently escapes King's Landing to the Vale with Littlefinger, and her experiences have clearly changed her personality. She had to learn from painful experience how to lie to survive at Joffrey's court, saying one thing but meaning another and manipulating people to her own ends as best she could. No longer under constant control by Joffrey and Cersei's guards, she is in her own way beginning to mature into her own power and influence as a political force.
The numerous tragedies she has suffered, and the crimes against herself and her family, have also darkened her personality turning her more ruthless, though not quite cruel. This shows when she refuses to take Theon's arm when he comes to escort her to the Godswood to marry Ramsay and coldly asks if he thinks she cares what Ramsay will do to him if she doesn't. She also later expresses approval of what Ramsay did to Theon, now Reek, and declares she would do the same. Once reclaiming Winterfell, Sansa feeds her abusive husband, Ramsay to his own hounds, even smiling as it happened.
However, despite all the suffering that she has been through, Sansa appears to have retained a certain degree of compassion that is also demonstrated in her multiple attempts at reaching out to Theon, especially after she gets him to finally forget Ramsay for once and confess the truth about Bran and Rickon. After Theon helps her escape from Winterfell, Sansa once again sees Theon as a surrogate brother and even says outright that she will do her best to stop Jon from harming him. Sansa also becomes more compassionate towards Jon, to the point that she apologizes to him for being ""awful"" to him when they were children; she may developed feelings of remorse for being generally mean to her half-brother, as shown when she insists for him to forgive her. She has also become significantly more brave, courageous and developing nerves of iron, since when she faced Myranda for the last time before her escape from Winterfell she was about to allow the psychopathic girl to shoot her so that she could die with as much of herself as was remaining.
Sansa is frequently praised as being very beautiful. She has been the victim of multiple attempts of sexual violence: Joffrey expresses a desire to rape her when she is wedded to Tyrion, she very nearly gets gang-raped in the King's Landing riots, and Littlefinger has a creepy obsession with Sansa (as she reminds him of her mother Catelyn, with whom he has always been hopelessly in love). Ramsay himself admits he finds her attractive and, in the letter he sends to Jon, threatens to have her gang-raped by his soldiers the next time he puts hands on her if Snow refuses to return her. Even Tyrion had a brief desire to sleep with her (but thought better of it considering her age), and Sandor tells Arya that he should have ""fucked her bloody"" when he had the chance during The Battle of Blackwater, but it's unclear how much he meant it. 
All the pain she had suffered through has made Sansa stronger and more mature, but also more war-like. No more caring about the traditional feminine virtues she used to praise as a child, Sansa even declares war against Ramsay in order to take back Winterfell and the North, and flat out rejects his conditions for saving her brother Rickon, knowing full well he would never keep his word anyway, and instead tells him that he will die the next day. Her experiences with the Lannisters have also enabled her to watch with dark glee as Ramsay is literally torn apart and eaten by his own hounds, while when she first arrived in King's Landing she was visibly horrified at the violence displayed by Gregor Clegane against Ser Hugh and Loras Tyrell, and fainted when her father was beheaded.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","Princess, Lady of Winterfell",Alive,"",Winterfell,House Stark,Northmen,"Old Gods of the Forest, Faith of the Seven","","",Eddard Stark,Catelyn Stark,"Tyrion Lannister (1st husband), Ramsay Bolton (2nd husband)","","Robb Stark, Arya Stark, Bran Stark, Rickon StarkJon Snow (paternal cousin raised as bastard half-brother)","",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/68/Sansa_stark_s6_battle_bastards_infobox.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160807084759,Sansa Stark,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1e/Mordane_History_and_Lore.png,A young Sansa being tutored by Septa Mordane.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e4/Sansa_in_the_Camp.jpg,"Sansa with her direwolf, Lady.",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/2e/Sansa_in_King%27s_Landing.jpg,Sansa Stark dining in King's Landing.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/62/Sansa.jpg,Sansa attends the Tourney and cheers for Ser Loras Tyrell.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c2/Pendant.jpg,"Joffrey gives a Lannister pendant to Sansa, identical to the one Cersei wears.",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1a/Ned%27s_execution.jpg,"Cersei, Joffrey, and Sansa watch as Eddard is executed.",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a8/Sansa_2x10.jpg,Joffrey forces Sansa to look upon the severed head of Eddard Stark.,House Stark

But he grows to respect and admire Daenerys and begins serving her in earnest. He saves her from an assassination attempt, stops sending reports to Varys and ignores an official royal pardon which would allow him to return home to Westeros. He develops strong and unrequited feelings for her.
When Daenerys learns of his past spying, he is dismissed from her service and ordered to leave her presence. He later captures Tyrion Lannister in the hope of winning his way back to her, an endeavor that leads to him contracting the deadly greyscale. After he helps saving her life from both the Sons of the Harpy and the Dothraki, Daenerys accepts him back to her service, and orders him to come back to her after he finds a cure to his disease.","Jorah Mormont is the son of Jeor Mormont of House Mormont, the Lords of Bear Island and vassals of House Stark in the North. Jorah had a distinguished early career, and participating in the Siege of Pyke during the Greyjoy Rebellion, for which he was knighted by King Robert Baratheon. His father later voluntarily joined the Night's Watch, leaving Jorah as Lord of Bear Island and head of House Mormont.
Jorah married Lynesse Hightower, but his new wife had expensive tastes that Jorah struggled to fund. Ultimately, he resorted to selling poachers into slavery, which has been illegal in the Seven Kingdoms for millennia and is a great taboo throughout Westeros. Jorah was caught and disgraced. He was stripped of his Lordship and fled to the Free Cities to avoid being executed by Eddard Stark. He served in mercenary companies such as the Golden Company. His wife eventually left him for another, richer man.
He is called Jorah the Andal by the Dothraki, as they assume that all people from Westeros are Andals. However, Jorah is actually a Northman, descended from the First Men.
Besides the Common Tongue of Westeros, Ser Jorah is fluent in the Dothraki language.","Jorah is a complex character, as he is Daenerys Targaryen's most loyal advisor and a formidable warrior. Jorah has a deep respect, loyalty and love for Daenerys, and has always tried to give her reasonable, practical, and effective advice. While Jorah is a moral person and always tries to be honorable, he has done several dishonorable acts out of love or for his own survival. He sold poachers into slavery to pay for his wife's spending habits, fled Westeros to escape execution, and briefly spied on Daenerys in the hope of receiving a royal pardon, though he stopped spying on her after becoming her advisor. Jorah is Daenerys' most level-headed advisor, at least until the arrival of Barristan Selmy.
Jorah is intelligent, literate and well travelled, knowing the histories of Essos and speaking several tongues, including Dothraki.
His relationship with his father, and likely the rest of his Mormont family, wasn't approached until the fifth season - although he never showed any feelings towards Jeor, once he was given the news about his death, Jorah was visibly shaken and deeply upset, even angrily demanding to know the details of his father's death. This is most likely because he was still feeling guilty about bringing his family shame and never fully reconciling with Jeor.
Although stoic, short-spoken and sometimes cold, Jorah does have the ability to warm up to people once they earn his respect - at first he treated Tyrion like a hostage, but later, after the two barely survived the sinking of their boat, he started to trust Tyrion enough to leave him untied and later the two men shared their life stories and freely discussed Daenerys and her claim to the throne, although their newfound trust was shattered when Tyrion convinced Daenerys to exile Jorah from Meereen again (which he did to spare him Daenerys's wrath).
He is also a skilled warrior, though he does have a honor code, and tries not to kill his opponent if such option is possible - this is shown in the fighting pit, where every other warrior was brutally slaughtering one another, but Jorah came victorious without any loss of life in his hands. This worked in his favor since he was aware that Daenerys was becoming increasingly appalled by the needless violence happening in the pit right before Jorah got into the skirmish. And even after using brute force to harm another person, he does seem to try compensate for his actions, as he did give some money to a knocked out fisherman for his stolen boat.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","Lord of Bear Island (formerly), Ser",Alive,"",Bear Island,"Queensguard, House Targaryen, Varys",Northmen,Old Gods of the Forest,Jeor Mormont,Maege Mormont,Jeor Mormont,"",Lynesse Hightower (separated),"","","",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c1/Ser_Jorah_s6_main_new.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160702233345,Jorah Mormont,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1f/Jorah_Pyke.png,Jorah fighting in the Siege of Pyke.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/17/Daenerys_1x03.png,Daenerys and Jorah Mormont in the Dothraki sea.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1f/Jorah_and_Rakharo_1x03.jpg,Jorah and Rakharo debate combat techniques.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/56/Jorah_and_Viserys.jpg,Jorah warning Viserys.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/ca/Dany-jorah-market.png,Ser Jorah foils the assassination attempt of the Wineseller in the markets of Vaes Dothrak.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/66/Daenerys.png,Ser Jorah carries Daenerys to the tent.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/90/Jorah_%26_Daenerys_1x10.png,Jorah tries to prevent Daenerys from stepping onto the pyre.,House Targaryen

Aerion demanded a rare trial by seven - a seven man team led by Duncan against a seven man team led by Aerion, considered very dangerous, but Duncan won the day.

Arya Stark,"Princess Arya Stark is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. She is played by starring cast member Maisie Williams, and debuts in the series premiere. Arya is the third child and second daughter of Lord Eddard Stark and his wife, Lady Catelyn Stark. She is later trained as a Faceless Man at the House of Black and White in Braavos.","Arya Stark is the youngest daughter and third child of Lady Catelyn and Lord Eddard Stark. Eddard was the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rules the region from their seat of Winterfell and Eddard also holds the title Lord of Winterfell. He is also the Warden of the North to King Robert Baratheon.
Arya was born and raised at Winterfell. She has an older sister, Sansa Stark. She also has an older brother, Robb, two younger brothers, Bran and Rickon and a ""bastard half-brother"", Jon Snow.
Arya rejects the notion that she must become a lady and marry for influence and power, instead she believes she can forge her own destiny. She is fascinated by warfare and training in the use of arms, and is bored by embroidery and other ""lady-like"" pursuits. She takes after her father and has a quarrelsome relationship with her sister Sansa, due to their contrasting interests and personalities. She is close to her ""half-brother"" Jon, who is also something of an outcast.","Arya is a fiercely independent child who is unconstrained by social expectations like gender roles, courtly virtues, class distinctions, and the expectations of her parents and siblings. A tomboy, she never aspired to be a ""proper lady"" as her older sister Sansa did. Before the series of events that shatter her innocence and destroy her support system, Arya is full of life, and she makes others smile just by virtue of her spirited indifference to rules. 
Once she begins the journey to King's Landing, however, she endures a constant stream of loss and trauma. As she watches her pet, sword instructor, friends, and family members taken from her one by one, she becomes increasingly detached towards murder and death. This is only exacerbated when she is captured by the Hound and is exposed to his fatalistic world view as they traverse the war-ravaged Riverlands, though the two develop a mutual reliance and almost grudging respect for each other. When she witnesses and learns of the betrayal and murder of her family at the Red Wedding, she becomes even more cold and driven to seek revenge on those who have wronged her and her family.
While she is initially horrified when she accidentally stabs the stableboy in King's Landing during the betrayal of her father and his men, by the time she and the Hound have fled the massacre at the Twins, she is able to kill without remorse and has accepted Syrio's belief that the only true god is Death. Following Yoren's advice to her before he died, she has taken to listing off the names of each person she intends to kill each night before she sleeps.
Arya can be a rather cold-blooded, slightly sadistic person at times, especially while confronting and killing those who are on her death list. Though she was initially apathetic but satisfied over killing Meryn Trant and Polliver, she did not attempt to hide her glee over slitting Walder Frey's throat. While she certainly possesses compassion and kindness, her time with The Hound and the Faceless Men have taught her to be ruthless to those who have wronged her and her family and has shown to be willing to use psychological mind games to worsen her enemies fate before killing them. Shown when she repeated every word Polliver said to Lommy before killing him in the same exact way with Needle; gouged the eyes of Ser Meryn before stabbing him repeatedly and butchering Lord Walder's sons before serving their corpses to their father inside of a pie.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7",Princess,Alive,"",Winterfell,"House Stark, Faceless Men",Northmen,"Old Gods of the Forest , Faith of the Seven , Many-Faced God (formerly)","","",Eddard Stark,Catelyn Tully,"","","Robb Stark, Sansa Stark, Bran Stark, Rickon StarkJon Snow (paternal cousin raised as bastard half-brother)","",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/ad/Arya6x10.png/revision/latest?cb=20160629211505,Arya Stark,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/09/Arya_History_and_Lore.png,"Arya as a little girl sitting with her mother, Catelyn.",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/31/Nymeria-and-Arya-Stark-game-of-thrones-direwolves-26320407-498-280.jpg,Arya says goodbye to Nymeria.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d9/Ned_and_Arya.jpg,Arya and her father at the Crossroads Inn.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/77/Arya%2C_Ned_and_Syrio_1x03.jpg,Syrio Forel trains Arya.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/61/Arya_1x09.png,Arya during her father's execution.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/dc/Arya.png,Arya defends herself with Needle.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c6/Arya_and_Gendry_2x02.jpg,Arya and Gendry hide from the Goldcloaks.,House Stark

Mern IX Gardener,"King Mern Gardener, also known as Mern IX, is a character mentioned in special features of the first season. He was the last of the Gardener Kings of the Reach. When Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros, King Mern joined forces with Loren Lannister, the King of the Rock, to face Aegon in battle. Their armies met at the Field of Fire, during which Mern himself was killed, and his kingdom fell to Aegon.","At first the united armies of Lannister and Gardener seemed to be winning, pushing back Aegon's troops. However, once Aegon unleashed his three dragons - Vhagar, Meraxes and Balerion the Black Dread - even the combined might of the Kingdoms of the Reach and the Rock could not stand up to them. Four thousand men perished, consumed by the dragons' fire, earning the site of the battle the name of 'the Field of Fire.' Among the dead were King Mern himself and all of his sons; thus the Gardener dynasty became extinct. Mern's steward, Harlen Tyrell, surrendered Highgarden to Aegon and was named Lord Paramount of the Reach, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South.
Seem that King Mern wasn't inclined to a war initially, like it would have been a sure defeat, but is implied that Lord Harlen Tyrell had suggest Mern to going to war to not appear weak and coward, with the intention to reclaim the Reach for himself.","",1,King of the Reach,Deceased,Burned alive by dragons on the Field of Fire,Highgarden,House Gardener,"","","","","","","","","","",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0a/Mern_gardener.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130301192329,Mern IX Gardener,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b5/MernCorpse.jpg,Mern IX and his sons were burned alive at the Field of Fire.

Craster,"Craster is a recurring character in the second and third seasons. He is played by guest star Robert Pugh and debuts in ""The North Remembers.""

He lives in a fortified homestead, rather grandly called Craster's Keep, along with his daughters and wives. When his daughters grow old enough he marries them, and then incestuously fathers new children with them. At the time of the War of the Five Kings, he has nineteen wives. He is counted as an ally of the Night's Watch and allows his keep to be used as a redoubt by the Watch on their rangings northwards. However, he is also regarded as an unsavory character and his relationship with his daughters is regarded as sordid. The Night's Watch grudgingly has to tolerate this, as he is one of their few sources of information and shelter beyond the Wall.","Craster was a cruel, domineering man who sired dozens of illegitimate, incestuous children with his own daughters whom he raised until they were old enough to be wedded to create more generations of daughters, repeating the cycle over and over again. He also fathered ninety-nine ill-conceived sons all of whom he simply abandoned as a sacrifice to the White Walkers. Craster was able to exploit an advantage to its full extent, throughout technically keeping his word whilst assuring that he received a greater benefit. He used this with his alliance to the Night's Watch by providing Jeor Mormont with information regarding Mance Rayder's movements beyond the Wall but only after being bribed to reveal such vital information and allowing a group of the Night's Watch to stay under his Keep but feeding them less than his prized pig, simply letting them starve in the cold. He was also very possessive of his daughter-wives, threatening to gouge out the eyes of any man who looked at them and castrate those who touched them. He did not seem to feel any genuine affection for his wives though. They were simply an extension of his property and he regularly abused them. However, he was implied to be insecure of his bastard status, reacting with fury and violence when Rast calls him one and hypocritically mocking Jon Snow for his surname and baseborn because of this. Craster was one of the few wildlings who didn't fear or feel threatened by the White Walkers' presence, assuming they were going to win anyway and planned to worship them as Gods after their success, providing them with numerous sacrifces as a peace offering.","2, 3","",Deceased,Slain by Karl Tanner,"Craster's Keep, Beyond the Wall","",Free Folk,White Walkers,"","","","","Morag, Gilly, Sissy, Unnamed woman, Unnamed woman, Unnamed woman, Unnamed woman, numerous others","Morag, Gilly, Sissy, Unnamed woman, Unnamed woman, Unnamed woman, Unnamed woman, Sam, Unnamed baby, 99 sons and even more daughters","","",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/78/CrasterHD3x03.png/revision/latest?cb=20160829161002,Craster,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/07/Craster.png,Craster talks to Jeor Mormont,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/2a/CrastersKeepSeason2.png,Craster's Keep,"","","","","","","","","","",""

Viserys Targaryen,"King Viserys III Targaryen is a major character in the first season. He is played by starring cast member Harry Lloyd, and debuts in the series premiere. Viserys is the younger brother of the late Rhaegar Targaryen, the older brother of Daenerys Targaryen, and the paternal uncle of Jon Snow. Viserys and Daenerys are the remnants of the exiled House Targaryen following Robert's Rebellion against their father Aerys II Targaryen, the Mad King.","Viserys is the second son and heir of King Aerys II Targaryen, the former ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. During Robert's Rebellion, after Viserys's older brother Rhaegar was killed at the Battle of the Trident, his father sent Viserys and his pregnant mother Queen Rhaella to safety on Dragonstone island. King Aerys was soon afterwards killed during the Sack of King's Landing along with Rhaegar's widow and children, and thus at the age of only five Viserys became the titular head of House Targaryen, though by this point the war was officially lost. Not long afterwards, his mother died in childbirth, while the forces of Robert Baratheon closed in on the island. Before they could arrive, Viserys and his baby sister Daenerys were smuggled to safety in the Free Cities, across the Narrow Sea on the continent of Essos. Bereft of followers, Viserys spent the next 17 years traveling between the Free Cities trying to find new supporters for an attempt to retake the Iron Throne. At times, however, he was left literally begging for food and shelter, much less an army.
Viserys claims the title of Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and refers to Robert Baratheon only as ""the Usurper"". After years spent fruitlessly wandering the Free Cities seeking military support to retake his throne, Viserys and Daenerys became guests of the powerful Magister Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos.","Viserys was, in so many ways, the precise opposite of his sister Daenerys Targaryen. He was condescending, violent, arrogant, immoral and extremely cruel. He suffered from maniacal delusions of grandeur, and was intensely self-righteous. Much like Joffrey Baratheon, Viserys believed that people should obey him simply in regards to status and, in his view, birthright. Viserys was a violent and aggressive man, and described his temper as 'a dragon', but also referring to himself as such, showing that he believes he is the greatest of the Targaryens. Viserys's temper hopelessly outweighs his common sense, making him rash and exceptionally reckless.
Viserys also held extremely little regard for either the safety or opinions of others. An example of this was him promising Jorah Mormont that he would not be punished for trading in slaves when he was king and even implied that he would become involved in it, ignoring or discarding the fact that slavery has been forbidden and condemned in Westeros since before there were even Seven Kingdoms. Viserys was also extremely self-deluded and believed himself to be a mighty warrior, something akin to his brother Rhaegar Targaryen, but in actuality he had never wielded a sword against an opponent in his life and didn't truly know the first thing about combat, strategy or warfare, only ever seeing the moment where he would gloriously sit upon the Iron Throne as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
In regards to his sister Daenerys, Viserys is extremely cruel to her - Viserys does not regard her as a human being with emotions and rights, but rather as a property for him to abuse or hand out to others whenever he pleases. He constantly beats and abuses her verbally, and levels her self-esteem regardless of her human nature. He also viewed her derogatively as a whore to Khal Drogo, not measuring her intelligence or empathy or promise in favour of her being another bridge for him to step over in order to take Westeros for himself. Viserys, nevertheless, self-righteously believes that she is loyal to him and nobody else, shown by the fact that, before his death, he begs for her to help him, despite him giving her absolutely no moral provocation to do so. In fact, only moments before, he had threatened to cut her open with a sword.
Daenerys believes that the loss of their mother, father and brother and having to beg everyone for money and shelter has driven Viserys mad, due to him being kind and respectful to her once.",1,"King of the Andals and the First Men (claimant), Lord of the Seven Kingdoms (claimant), Protector of the Realm (claimant)",Deceased,Burned with molten gold by Khal Drogo,King's Landing,House Targaryen,Valyrian,Faith of the Seven,"","",Aerys II Targaryen,Rhaella Targaryen,"","","Rhaegar Targaryen, Daenerys Targaryen","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/46/Viseryspromoheadshot.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160730184148,Viserys Targaryen,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/2f/Young_Viserys.jpg,Viserys as a child before he went into exile.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d9/Viserys_Targaryen.jpg,Prince Viserys in exile in Pentos.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d4/Daenerys_and_Viserys.jpg,Viserys kisses Daenerys on her forehead.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3a/Viserys-threat.png,Viserys threatens his sister.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/2f/Doreahbath.png,Doreah and Viserys share a bath.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/87/Goldencrown.jpg,Viserys faces his coming death.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d4/Viserysgoldencrown.jpg,Viserys is slain.,House Targaryen

He ruled over the Riverlands from the castle of Riverrun.","Hoster was the head of House Tully and the Lord Paramount of the Riverlands. The Riverlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Tully is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Tully rules the region from their seat at Riverrun and Hoster also holds the title Lord of Riverrun.
Hoster married Lady Minisa of House Whent. They have three children, two daughters Catelyn and Lysa and a son, Edmure. Only three of their six children survived. Minisa died shortly after bearing their last child, which died with her. Hoster brokered a marriage alliance with the Lords Paramount of the North House Stark, betrothing his eldest daughter Catelyn to their heir Brandon Stark.
Hoster fought in the War of the Ninepenny Kings where Lord Baelish befriended him and later agreed to foster his son Petyr at Riverrun. When he returned from the war, he arranged a marriage for his brother Brynden to Bethany Redwyne, but Brynden refused causing Hoster to nickname him ""The Blackfish"" and a falling out between the brothers that lasted the rest of Hoster's life.
The Mad King Aerys II Targaryen had Brandon and his father brutally executed, triggering a rebellion against him. Hoster joined House Stark, House Baratheon and House Arryn in opposing the Mad King. Catelyn married Brandon's brother Eddard Stark and Hoster arranged for Lysa to marry Lord Jon Arryn to solidify the alliance. They won the war and installed Robert Baratheon as the King on the Iron Throne. The army of Lord Walder Frey, Hoster's bannerman, arrived after the Battle of the Trident had already been won by the rebels, causing Hoster to nickname him ""the Late Lord Frey"" to Lord Walder's great irritation.
In recent years Hoster had become old and frail, losing a great deal of weight. By the beginning of the War of the Five Kings, Hoster had been bedridden for a considerable amount of time from a prolonged illness, and only semi-coherent. His son and heir Edmure took over the day-to-day rule of Riverrun, and Hoster's other duties as overlord of the Riverlands.","",3,"Lord of Riverrun, Lord Paramount of the Trident",Deceased,"",Riverrun,House Tully,Andal,"","",Edmure Tully,"","",Minisa Tully,"Catelyn Stark, Lysa Arryn, Edmure Tully",Brynden Tully,"",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a3/Hoster_Tully.png/revision/latest?cb=20140615193244,Hoster Tully,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/9b/Hoster_tully.jpg,Lord Hoster during Robert's Rebellion.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/9a/Hoster_Baelish.jpg,Petyr Baelish's father (left) befriends Lord  during the War of the Ninepenny Kings.,"","","","","","","","","","",House Tully

Barristan Selmy is noted as an extremely capable warrior, even in his old age, and has a reputation for honor and chivalry that is second to none. He served in the Kingsguard of Aerys II Targaryen. He fought in the battle against the Kingswood Brotherhood and slew their leader Simon Toyne.Jaime Lannister, then aged 16, squired for Selmy during the battle and greatly admired his skill.
He also attended the The Great Tourney at Harrenhal, in which he danced with Ashara Dayne.
Although dismayed by King Aerys' many acts of insane cruelty, Ser Barristan had great admiration and loyalty for Aerys' son and heir Rhaegar Targaryen. He never wavered in his loyalty to House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion, in accordance with the vows he swore when he joined the Kingsguard; he fought alongside Rhaegar's army at the Battle of the Trident, where Rhaegar was killed and Selmy was wounded. Both Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark held Ser Barristan in very high esteem.
Upon assuming the throne, in spite of Roose Bolton's advice to execute Selmy, Robert pardoned him and made him Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.","A seasoned knight, Barristan Selmy served under the Kingsguard of King Aerys Targryen and Robert Baratheon and protected them both all his life. Though he was an old man when he came into the service of Robert and Daenerys Targaryen, Barristan was a courageous and fierce fighter who could duel evenly with much younger and skilled swordsman, once even claiming that he could cut into the five Kingsguard like ""carving a cake"" (Considering that barely any of the Kingsguard present were especially skilled warriors, this was probably true). He valued honour greatly and grew disgusted how Cersei and Joffrey were weeding the Small Council and court with sycophants; in rage he surrendered his title of Lord Commander but refused Varys' offer as he was a knight and would die a knights death. Like most honourable men, Barristan held disdain towards the Kingslayer, viewing it as a great insult as a man who vowed to defend his King, stabbed him in the back and was knighted for such an act.
However, Barristan's dutiful personality put him at odds that he could be too honourable at times. As a knight does not question or go against the wishes of his King, no matter what the King has or will do, with the Mad King, he could only watch as Aerys burnt innocent people alive and do nothing about it due to the oath he had sworn. While this exemplified the fact that he was an extremely honourable man, it also marred his conscience for the rest of his life. He understood Robert was a bad king but served him faithfully nonetheless but when Joffrey relinquished him entirely, Barristan vowed to serve under a king who he was proud to serve and believed in. His loyalty to his monarch was such that he was verbally incredulous when Cersei tore up Robert's final decree, stating that they were the King's words.
Barristan was also a deep supporter of House Targaryen. Though he was horrified regarding the acts that Aerys committed, he still fought to retain the Targaryen Dynasty during the Sack of King's Landing and was close with Rheagar, Aerys' son whom he bodyguarded. Though he served under the man who killed Rheagar and stole Aerys' throne, he continued to support the Targaryens and finally assisted the Mad King's last living heir, Daenerys in helping her seize her birthright. Ser Barristan Selmy was extremely brave, being completely able to confront a ring of Sons of the Harpy with only a sword and no armour, while his faceless opponents had the advantage of armoured faces, numbers and weapons. Barristan fought incredibly well for a man of his age, cutting down a great number of the Sons without even crossing swords twice, even continuing after he was severely disoriented - what is fitting is that one of the greatest warriors that the Seven Kingdoms knew died the way he always wanted to, fighting against the forces of a malevolent and dangerous enemy with a sword in hand.","1, 3, 4, 5","Ser, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard (formerly)",Deceased,Slain while fighting the Sons of the Harpy,Harvest Hall,Queensguard,Andal,"","Gerold Hightower (as Lord , Commander of the Kingsguard)",Jaime Lannister (as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard),"","","","","","",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1f/Barristan_Selmy_Sons_of_the_Harpy.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150504180820,Barristan Selmy,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/bb/Barristan_kills_Maelys.png,Young Barristan slays Maelys the Monstrous.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/2b/Barristan_and_Robert.png,A wounded Barristan with Robert Baratheon after the Battle of the Trident.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/80/Barristan_and_Eddard.jpg,Barristan Selmy talks with Lord Stark.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4c/Barristan.png,Barristan reads the last words of King Robert.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d1/Ser_Barristan_challenging_the_court..jpg,Ser Barristan challenging the court.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/fc/Barristan_meets_daenerys.png,Barristan joins Daenerys.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/ac/Daenerys_orders_barristan_and_jorah_to_not_question_her.png,Daenerys orders Jorah and Barristan to never question her again in public.,""

Margaery Tyrell,"Queen Margaery Tyrell is a major character in the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons. She is played by Natalie Dormer and debuts in ""What is Dead May Never Die"". Margaery was the only daughter of Lord Mace Tyrell and Lady Alerie Tyrell, granddaughter of Lady Olenna Tyrell and sister of Ser Loras Tyrell. Margaery became Queen Consort through her marriage to King Joffrey Baratheon, and later his younger brother Tommen Baratheon following Joffrey's death. She was killed when the Great Sept of Baelor was destroyed with wildfire as orchestrated by Cersei Lannister.","Margaery is the only daughter of Lady Alerie Tyrell and Lord Mace Tyrell, the Lord Paramount of the Reach. The Reach is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Tyrell is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Margaery was raised in privilege in the family seat and regional capital of Highgarden. She is close to her brother, Ser Loras Tyrell, the Knight of Flowers. She is also close to her handmaidens, Sera Durwell and Mira Forrester, who followed her to King's Landing from Highgarden. She is said to be as beautiful as she is clever.","Margaery's beauty was equaled by her cleverness, which she had in abundance. A true protégée of her grandmother Olenna, she was a gifted manipulator who knew how to maneuver her way in court politics. Margaery's strength was in her ability to win the minds and loyalties of her subjects, which had proven to be a threat to those who rival her family, such as the Lannisters. She demonstrated her formidable skill in her charity work to win over the commoners of King's Landing, as well as her manipulation of Joffrey by making him think she was excited by his dark impulses. In return Margaery gained the acceptance of both her subjects and Joffrey, who was an unpredictable and uncontrollable madman to everyone else, including his mother. This proved to be a threat to Cersei, who only relied on the fear of her family name and her position as a source of power.
Margaery possessed the tact and politeness that Cersei lacks. While Cersei is blunt and often rude, Margaery was capable of exuding the courtly behavior and courtesies expected of a queen - while still privately engaging in palace intrigues to increase her family's power. Cersei scorns her status as a woman in a realm dominated by men, though she is willing to use sex as a weapon to seduce those she needs (such as her cousin Lancel). In contrast, Margaery worked within the social standards of ""proper"" femininity in Westeros, but adeptly turned them to her favor, to orchestrate political machinations from behind the scenes.
​Although Margaery had to develop many different facades depending on who she is trying to manipulate, she was shown to genuinely have a good heart, compassion, and empathy. Margaery had loving relationships with all of her family members. She loved her brother Loras and was entirely tolerant of his homosexuality - to the point that when her father contracted a marriage-alliance between herself and Loras's own lover Renly, she acknowledged that it was a paper marriage, and was quite frank that she had no issues with her new husband continuing his sexual relationship with her brother. She also showed genuine concern and tried to form a friendship with Sansa, even offering her help to get out of King's Landing once married to Joffrey - though this may have been in part because she had the more long-term goal of good relations with the North, sensing that the unstable Lannisters wouldn't be in power forever. She shared a very strong bond with her grandmother, sharing her acuity for manipulation and political maneuvering. Though she had developed many facades in order to sway the opinions of others in her favor, she was extremely loyal to her family and house, and would go to great lengths to keep them safe. Though she was willing and able to feign affection for Renly and Joffrey, she genuinely cared for Tommen and bore him no ill will when he failed to stop the arrest of both her and her brother, a feeling which he reciprocated to such an extent that he willingly committed suicide when she was murdered by Cersei.","2, 3, 4, 5, 6",Queen Consort,Deceased,Burned alive in a wildfire explosion orchestrated by Cersei Lannister,Highgarden,House Tyrell,Andal,"","","",Mace Tyrell,Alerie Tyrell,"Renly Baratheon (1st husband; unconsummated), Joffrey Baratheon (2nd husband; unconsummated), Tommen Baratheon (3rd husband)","",Loras Tyrell,"",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b5/Margaery_Tyrell_S6.png/revision/latest?cb=20160729224605,Margaery Tyrell,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/9d/Margaery_and_Renly.jpg,Margaery and her betrothed Renly Baratheon.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e7/LorasMargaery.jpg,Margaery and her brother Ser Loras,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/74/Margaery_love_2x10.jpg,Margaery is proposed to be wed to Joffrey Baratheon.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/67/Margaery_handmaiden_S3_Ep1.png,Margaery in Flea Bottom.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/77/Sansamarg.png,Margaery and Olenna dine with Sansa Stark.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/93/Margjoff.png,Margaery and Joffrey tour the Great Sept of Baelor.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/13/Jofrey_Margaery_waving_S3E4.jpg,Joffrey and Margaery wave at the pleased crowd.,House Tyrell

Tyrion Lannister,"Tyrion Lannister is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. He is played by starring cast member Peter Dinklage and debuts in the series premiere. Tyrion Lannister is the youngest son of Lord Tywin Lannister and younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister. A dwarf, he uses his wit and intellect to overcome the prejudice he faces.","Tyrion Lannister is the youngest son of Joanna Lannister and Lord Tywin Lannister. Tywin is the head of House Lannister, the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms and Lord Paramount of the Westerlands. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of the realm. He is the younger brother of Jaime and Cersei Lannister. His mother Joanna Lannister died giving birth to him. His father and sister hold him in contempt as they blame him for the death.
He is a dwarf, causing him problems and persecution. His size has led him to being referred to derisively by various names, such as ""the Imp"" and ""The Halfman"". This is mitigated by his intellect and his family's wealth and power. Had an infant with dwarfism like Tyrion been born a commoner, he'd have simply been left out in the woods to die. However, Tyrion was born into a powerful noble House, and was therefore spared. Even though his father doesn't think much of him, he has had the benefits of being raised with wealth and education, and is expected to lead his life as a credit to the Lannister name. He is committed to the good of both his House and, since Cersei married King Robert Baratheon, his family's continued hold on the throne.
When Tyrion was 16, he met a wheelwright's daughter named Tysha on the road, apparently the victim of an attempted rape. While his brother Jaime ran off the attackers, Tyrion helped Tysha recover from the ordeal, and they became lovers. They found a drunken, wandering septon willing to marry them and briefly, they lived as husband and wife. That is, until Lord Tywin learned what had happened. Jaime confessed that he organized the incident to make his brother happy, and Tysha was actually a prostitute. As a lesson, Tywin gave Tysha to his guards, paying her a silver coin for each man and forcing Tyrion to watch. By the end, there were so many silver coins that they were running out of her hands onto the ground. Tyrion has reciprocated Tywin's hatred ever since.
His two siblings have had positions of respect and responsibility since their teens. When Tyrion turned sixteen (the age of manhood), Tywin Lannister put Tyrion in charge of the drains and cisterns at Casterly Rock. Tyrion brags that the ""[sewage] never flowed [smoother] to the sea.""
Tyrion once encountered Lord Gregor Forrester at the Tourney in Lannisport. While they once spoke briefly, Tyrion found Gregor very honorable, even mentioning it to Gregor's daughter Mira years later.
Tyrion spends a lot of time at court in King's Landing to avoid his father. He gets on well with Jaime and his niece Myrcella and nephew Tommen, but has a colder relationship with Cersei and his sadistic nephew Joffrey. He has a fondness for prostitutes and drink, but is also intelligent, cunning, and educated. He also is a kind man who would protect the innocent claiming that he loves broken things.","Tyrion recognized from an early age that his mind was his greatest weapon, due to being born a member of House Lannister with the expectation of upholding his family's noble name, yet lacking the physical attributes possessed by his older siblings. Thus, he has committed himself to possessing a sharp intellect in order to help make up for his dwarfism, and he is frequently able to use his superior intellect to get the better of those who initially look down upon him or weasel his way out of tight situations, though he is not above resorting to using his family name and enormous fortune to bolster his position. He has also shown himself to possess a keen mind for strategy, as is evidenced in his research into defending against sieges and successfully conducting the defense of King's Landing during the Battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion prides himself on his ability to read people as easily as he does books, and he has on many occasions easily gotten the better of not just Joffrey and Cersei but also experienced players such as Littlefinger and Pycelle. 
Despite his harsh treatment at the hands of others over the years, Tyrion has managed to develop a thick skin, able to brush off others' japes about his short stature (except when coming from his father). Tyrion advised Jon Snow how to handle his own bastard status, which reflects Tyrion's own approach to life: take your impediment in stride and wear it like armor, so it cannot be used to hurt you. Being born a dwarf and subject to ridicule for most of his life, Tyrion has admittedly developed a soft spot for his fellow outcasts and has shown them kindness, such as having a saddle designed for the crippled Bran Stark allowing him to ride. Being physically weak, Tyrion is also upset when the helpless are harmed. He was particularly insulted when Janos Slynt carried out an order to kill a defenseless baby girl, Barra (because she was one of Robert's bastards), and as punishment had him exiled to the Wall. Tyrion is also genuinely loyal to those who treat him with love and respect. He also seemed to have a level of honor and dignity that his family seemed to lack; events such as the Red Wedding disgusted him, and he considered them to be crimes (though he did admit that there was a certain level of ""cheating"" in war that he is comfortable with, the Red Wedding went beyond that).
Tyrion, however, is not without faults. He tends to overindulge in food, drink, and sex in part to self-medicate for the terrible treatment he's suffered most of his life. Tyrion can also act vicious if he feels he's been wronged - such as confining Grand Maester Pycelle to the Black Cells for betraying him or, in his darkest hour, killing Shae for testifying against him during his trial and having an affair with his father, and then going on to kill Tywin himself. Because his father and sister treated him like a social leper, Tyrion craves love and acceptance and is genuinely hurt when this is denied him by others. 
He has complex relationships with other members of his family, most of whom resent him and only thinly veil their contempt for his existence. His older sister Cersei blames him for causing the death of their mother and has (as revealed during a conversation with Oberyn) hated Tyrion since his birth. His father, Tywin, shares Cersei's resentment for Tyrion due to the death of his wife while birthing him, as Joanna Lannister was the only person Tywin ever loved. Although Tywin recognizes and respects Tyrion's intellect, it does not lessen his prejudice towards his youngest son; by the same token Tyrion fears and admires his father, but hates him for his inflexibility and unwillingness to show any love for his children. Tywin also just thinks it is an embarrassment that Tyrion was born with a physical disability, seeing it as a judgement from the gods meant to humiliate him by his son's mere existence.
Only Tyrion's older brother Jaime maintained a good relationship with Tyrion, admiring him for both his intellect and inability to let his diminished stature drag him down, and he has frequently attempted to come to Tyrion's defense when his other family members attempt to treat him maliciously, making Jaime the only member of his immediate family whom Tyrion loves. Tyrion harbors a mutual admiration for Jaime, even naming him as his champion when he demanded a trial by combat while being held prisoner at the Eyrie. However, this cozy relationship ended when Tyrion killed their father.
After he killed Shae and his father, Tyrion becomes a broken man: he had lost the will to live, traumatised by killing the woman he loved and losing his lordship, influence and fabulous wealth, he becomes more cynical and pessimistic and was content to just drink himself to death instead of helping Varys to aid Daenerys Targaryen in getting the Iron Throne. Tyrion becomes convinced in the futility of everything, gaining a negative and rather fatalistic outlook on the past and the future, to the point of suicidal as well gains a lower view for matters he dealt with high esteem and importance beforehand in the past, such as the Great Houses or the bid for the Iron Throne. Even when meeting Daenerys face to face, Tyrion explained that he was still content to die. However, while helping with the chaos in Mereen, and keeping Daenerys from becoming like her father in her ruthlessness, he regained his will to live. He also finally found something to believe in, as he believed in Daenerys.  ","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","Hand of the Queen (to Daenerys I), Master of Coin (formerly; to Joffrey I), Acting Hand of the King (formerly; to Joffrey I)",Alive,"",Casterly Rock,"House Lannister, House Targaryen",Andal,Faith of the Seven,"Eddard Stark (Hand of the King), Petyr Baelish (Master of Coin)","Tywin Lannister (Hand of the King), Mace Tyrell (Master of Coin)",Tywin Lannister,Joanna Lannister,"Tysha (annulled), Sansa Stark (unconsummated)","","Cersei Lannister, Jaime Lannister",Shae,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/9d/Tyrion6x082.png/revision/latest?cb=20160609061404,Tyrion Lannister,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/90/Winter_is_Coming_Tyrion_and_Ros.png,Tyrion visits a whorehouse upon his arrival in Winterfell.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d9/Tyrion_Lannister.jpg,Tyrion while in Winterfell,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/9a/Tyrion_and_Bran_1x04.png,Tyrion speaks with Bran.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/53/Tyrion_Lannister_in_the_Vale.jpg,Tyrion defends himself with the shield of House Bracken.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c0/Tyrion_and_Mord.jpg,Tyrion in the sky cells of the Eyrie.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/cd/Tyrion_and_Bronn_1x09.png,Tyrion drinks with Bronn before battle.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3f/Tyrion_and_Tywin_1x10.png,Tyrion discusses the future with his father.,House Lannister

Joffrey Baratheon,"King Joffrey I Baratheon is a major character in the first, second, third, and fourth seasons. He is played by starring cast member Jack Gleeson and debuts in the series premiere. Though believed by most to be the eldest son of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, Joffrey is actually a bastard born from Cersei's incestuous relationship with her twin brother, Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard. He is the older brother of Myrcella Baratheon and Tommen Baratheon, both of whom share the same parentage with Cersei and Jaime Lannister.","Joffrey is believed to be the oldest son and heir of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, both of whom entered into a political marriage alliance after Robert took the throne by force from the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen. In reality, his father is Jaime Lannister, the queen's brother and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Their sole biological grandparents, Tywin and Joanna Lannister, were also first cousins.
Joffrey takes after his mother in terms of looks and personality, his blond hair being a subtle clue that he isn't really a Baratheon, who famously always possess black hair even when one of their parents possesses blond hair. Cersei herself lets it slip to Catelyn Stark that she once had a child with black hair who died prematurely before she had Joffrey. He is usually accompanied by his sworn shield, the formidable Sandor Clegane, better known as the Hound. Even before he ascends to the Iron Throne, Joffrey is spoiled, arrogant, cowardly, and sadistic; however these traits are further exacerbated upon Robert's death and his ascension to the crown.","Joffrey was a cruel, arrogant, sadistic, malicious, and tyrannical ruler even by the standards of his time. He hugely enjoyed the agony of others, and playing sadistic games with them (for example, giving a man a choice between losing his fingers or his tongue), and even joyously speculating serving Sansa Stark the head of her brother Robb at his wedding feast. However, he was also incompetent, unintelligent, naive, impulsive, petulant, extremely cowardly, and prone to rash outbursts of violence when angered, frightened or even mildly slighted. Much like earlier Targaryen kings, it was suspected that Joffrey's sociopath behavior was a result of his incestuous bloodline (though his sister and brother both were of a kinder disposition). As well as being intensely sadistic, Joffrey was consumed by megalomaniacal delusions of grandeur, even though he was absurdly unskilled at ruling, making far more problems than he solved (though he was literally unable to see this and unapologetic for doing so).
He was convinced that he deserved praise and utter devotion from everyone around him because of his purported royal blood. Even though at the start of the War of the Five Kings most of the realm rose in rebellion against him, to the point that his faction essentially controlled only The Westerlands, The Crownlands, and a narrow strip of the southern Riverlands between them, Joffrey was convinced that he was the greatest king in the history of the Seven Kingdoms. Added to what was an unstable personality to begin with, Cersei utterly spoiled and indulged Joffrey his entire life, resulting in him possessing a massive sense of entitlement, along with having no impulse and self-control due to getting whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it, which knew no rational bounds. Cersei also outright told him that the world could be exactly as he wanted it to be, and this fuelled his narcissism to an extreme. Moreover, his father-figure King Robert was largely absent from his life and a terrible role-model, with his constant drinking and whoring (though Robert, at least, lamented on his deathbed that he hadn't been a good father).
He was deceitful, but showed even less tact than his mother. He was willing to take advantage of the trust that Sansa Stark initially placed in him, when she was blinded by fantasies of marrying her handsome prince. In general, however, Joffrey was usually too short-sighted to bother lying, often simply committing various atrocities in public, without concern for the consequences. Joffrey had precious little restraint emotionally, and would continuously resort to petty, impractical, illogical and childlike delights on violent degrees - for example, pouring wine over Tyrion's head, grinning at the brief duel between the Mountain and the Hound or sneering whilst scarring Mycah. Like a wild animal, he would cling on to any sadistic urge that clung to his mind, and never truly considered the long-term repercussions of his actions (Not unlike his mother Cersei, funnily enough). His execution of Ned Stark was more than likely an impulse decision for his own sole and personal enjoyment, than for the latter's supposed treason, and was a politically disastrous move that plunged the Seven Kingdoms into war.
Joffrey's view on his own family (Immediate and alleged both) was extremely influenced by his own impulsiveness and self-absorption. Despite her protectiveness of him and that she had supported him (Somewhat) his entire life, he was entirely comfortable being misogynistic and condescending towards Cersei - insulting her status as a woman, and mocking Robert Baratheon's disloyalty to her. He taunted and belittled his uncle (Really his father) Jaime Lannister over his status as (In Joffrey's opinion) an unexceptional knight, and the fact that he had lost a hand. In addition, he apparently bullied and tormented Tommen and Myrcella their entire lives, never connecting with them the way, for example, the Starks did, and even considering Tommen weak for crying like any normal person. Even his grandfather Tywin Lannister was a person he held in contempt, being arrogant enough to furiously accuse Tywin of being a coward during Robert's Rebellion, in comparison to Robert Baratheon (Who climactically killed Rhaegar Targaryen in combat and took the crown for himself). Based on this, Robert was probably the only relative that Joffrey held in any high regard - and Robert wasn't even Joffrey's father. The worst relationship that Joffrey had was with his uncle Tyrion, and on several occasions Tyrion stymied and accosted Joffrey for his sadistic, cruel and arrogant actions, and Joffrey at several points went to petty means of mocking and deriding him. This probably influenced Joffrey's urge to point at Tyrion mere moments before he died, as one final stab at his uncle for so much as standing in his way.
Joffrey was obsessed with the self-conception that he was a great warrior like King Robert, but displayed no martial skill. Joffrey never raised a weapon against an enemy combatant in his entire life, despite bragging melodramatically that he would personally cut down Robb Stark and Stannis Baratheon in battle (Which he never came close to at any point in the war). Particularly, despite the fact that his faction was losing the war and bracing for a siege in King's Landing, Joffrey insisted that was the time for him to strike against the Stark forces as they were distracted by the Fall of Winterfell. However, Tyrion pointed out that his own city was on the verge of attack by Stannis's superior forces. His delusions are so extensive that during breakfast prior to his wedding - Joffrey noted, after receiving the Valyrian steel sword Widow's Wail, that using it would be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again - implying that he was the one who beheaded Lord Eddard, even though he simply ordered it and Ilyn Payne was the one who actually beheaded him. He also boasted, before the Battle of the Blackwater, that he would personally engage Stannis and kill him in combat, but never crossed the latter in combat throughout the entirety of the battle. Later on, to add stupidity to absurdity, he arrogantly claimed that he saved King's Landing and personally broke Stannis Baratheon at the Battle of Blackwater, when it was in fact entirely down to his uncle and grandfather's military efforts, whereas Joffrey turned coward and fled the battle, and Stannis himself was not entirely broken because he could still pose a threat to his opponents in the war and his claim still stood to reason. His bloodlust was often overpowered by sheer cowardice. He rarely killed manually nor did he initiate a fight in which he had an extremely unfair advantage or begging or walking away when he lost this advantage. Because of this he preferred tormenting animals rather than fighting warriors and regularly went on hunts because of this (akin to Robert).
Aptly described as a vicious idiot by his uncle Tyrion, Joffrey was not simply a ruthless exceedingly, cruel tyrant, but absurdly incompetent. While Robert was also not skilled at ruling (though not as bad as Joffrey), he was at least respected as a great warrior. Joffrey, in contrast, had no redeeming values whatsoever: literally his only claim to rule was that he was the son of Robert, the previous king. The great irony, of course, was that Joffrey was actually Jaime's bastard son and had no valid claim to the throne, but a shockingly large number of Joffrey's followers continued to blindly obey his crazed orders without question. After hearing the rumors of his true parentage, Joffrey unwisely ordered that all of Robert's bastards be killed to make sure nobody would legitimately challenge his claim, which backfired drastically and only served to heighten suspicions when the people saw it as Joffrey destroying the evidence of the truth.
Joffery possesses all of the classical traits of sociopathy, as he possesses an outrageous temper, is delusional, and quick to torment and harm anyone who displeases him. He is known for his unstable mannerisms and affect when insulted, and has a short fuse to say the least. His ability to feel empathy is extraordinarily limited (if its even there at all), and has no ability or desire to expand it, and he is entirely apathetic and even cold towards his brother Tommen when the latter cries over the departure of his sister Myrcella - he even conceitedly claimed that princes shouldn't cry, despite the fact that he was witnessed crying himself. When confronted with this fact, he brushed it aside when Sansa pointed out that her brother Rickon cried himself, to which Joffrey claimed it was irrelevant because Rickon Stark wasn't a prince and Joffrey was, but he did not stop to speculate that this didn't make the slightest scrap of difference.
Once in a while, Joffrey does make a valid point, such as that the feudal levy system in the Seven Kingdoms is somewhat antiquated, or that his advisors should be worried about Daenerys Targaryen reportedly hatching three new dragons in Essos or that his grandfather Tywin Lannister bided his time before he finally aided the rebels during Robert's Rebellion. Joffrey was capable of logic but only if the solution was absurdly obvious and even then he got it wrong. After being poisoned at his wedding feast he (incorrectly) assumed that it was Tyrions' doing. Presumably, he came to this conclusion due to his uncles constant chiding, insulting and threatening as well his use of physical punishment to discipline his wild, uncontrollable nephew or the fact that he was made cupbearer and the only person who held the opportunity to poison his wine (this makes no sense, however, as Joffrey made Tyrion his cupbearer on the spot to humiliate him further and he would have no chance to poison him). His hatred of his uncle might have also been a factor in this conclusion.
Generally, however, Joffrey only rarely made a valid insight as a means for the narrative to underscore that everyone else is overlooking something, i.e. ""if someone as stupid as Joffrey realized this, it should have been obvious to everyone else"". Even on those first two points Joffrey was quite short-sighted: he was concerned about Daenerys in the far east, despite the fact that Robb Stark was already leading major armies in rebellion in Westeros itself, and didn't consider that he should concentrate on the much more immediate threat (which is how Tyrion reacted to news of Daenerys). Similarly, while he vaguely said that having a standing royal army was better than using feudal levies, Cersei had to explain to him that his suggestion for how to make one was too impractical to work (if a royal army conscripts men from the North, they still wouldn't feel enthusiastic about attacking their fellow Northmen). Joffrey may also have been correct when he said that the Stark forces were distracted after the Fall of Winterfell, and that would have been the perfect opportunity to strike, but once again Tyrion had to remind him that his own city was preparing for a siege by Stannis Baratheon. Despite his lack of technical abilities and shortcomings in battle or combat, he was surprisingly knowledgeable on crossbows which he demonstrates to Margaery, knowing their make and models, effectiveness and was able to use them averagely well. His only direct kill with one, however, was Ros a prostitute whom he restrained and it was shown that he missed his shot multiple times due to the scattered arrows across the room.
Despite all these negative traits, however, Joffrey is shown to be capable of feeling emotion. On Robert's deathbed, he is visibly shocked and saddened at that his (legal) father may be dying and holds his hand, and (in the books) it is stated by various characters that Joffrey was very fond of Sandor Clegane despite his outwardly aloof manner towards him. He was probably more fond of the Hound because the man was a prolific and savage warrior, and had no complaints or restraints about killing, disregarding the fact that the Hound hated his even more savage brother, who was probably more aggressive and impractically violent than Joffrey himself, making him more interested in the Hound's combat prowess and aloofness (And Joffrey probably would have been terrified of the Mountain). He treated Margaery Tyrell much better than he did with Sansa Stark during their betrothal, although this is due to Margaery manipulating him by pretending to be intrigued by his playful sadism. On the other hand, he also acted charming and kind to Sansa, initially before turning her into his plaything to abuse and this one act was because his mother demanded him to do so, but he only became this way after her father confessed treason and her brother raised his armies against his claim. We will never know what their marriage would be like as he died on the eve of their wedding feast.","1, 2, 3, 4","King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, Lord Paramount of the Stormlands (disputed), Lord of Storm's End (disputed)",Deceased,"Poisoned with the strangler at his wedding feast by Olenna Tyrell with the unwitting assistance of Sansa Stark, orchestrated by Petyr Baelish",King's Landing,"House Baratheon of King's Landing, House Lannister",Andal,Faith of the Seven,"Robert Baratheon (as King of the Andals and the First Men), Renly Baratheon (as Lord of Storm's End)",Tommen Baratheon,"Jaime Lannister (biological), Robert Baratheon (legal)",Cersei Lannister,Margaery Tyrell,"","Myrcella Baratheon, Tommen Baratheon, Unnamed Baratheon (maternal half-brother)","",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/ea/Joff_promo_shot_infobox_image.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160809044359,Joffrey Baratheon,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/46/Winter_is_Coming_joffrey_looks_at_sansa.jpg,A young Joffrey in Winterfell flirting with Sansa.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/15/Joffrey_1x02.png,Joffrey is bitten by Nymeria.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/61/Cersei-joffrey.png,"Joffrey and his mother, Queen Cersei Lannister.",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/93/Cersei_%26_Joffrey_1x07.jpg,Joffrey as king.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1a/Ned%27s_execution.jpg,Joffrey after ordering the execution of Eddard Stark.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a7/Joffrey.png,Joffrey torments Sansa over her father's death.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a6/Joffrey%27s_sigil.jpg,"The sigil of King Joffrey Baratheon, which combines the heraldry of Houses Baratheon and Lannister.",House Baratheon of King's Landing
Lyanna Stark,"Lyanna Stark is a character in Game of Thrones. She is deceased when the events of the series begin but appears in a flashback in the sixth season. Lyanna Stark is the younger sister of major character Eddard Stark.
Her alleged kidnapping by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen contributed to the outbreak of Robert's Rebellion. She died near the very end of the rebellion, due to complications from giving birth to a baby boy, Jon Snow. Before she passed away, she begged Ned to promise her to keep her son safe out of fear that her betrothed Robert Baratheon would have him killed if he ever found out the truth that Jon's father was Rhaegar, which led to Ned raising Jon as his bastard son.","Lyanna Stark was the only daughter of Lord Rickard Stark, head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rule the region from their seat of Winterfell and Rickard also held the title Lord of Winterfell.
Lyanna had three brothers, Brandon, Eddard, and Benjen Stark. Her father arranged a betrothal between her and Robert Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands.
Some time after the betrothal, Lord Walter Whent organized a great tourney at Harrenhal, in which Lyanna saved Howland Reed from a group of squires. Later, she took him to their tent, where she introduced him to her three brothers. Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the heir to the Iron Throne, was the victor. Afterwards, the Prince rode past his wife, Princess Elia Martell, and placed a crown of winter roses, the crown of the Queen of Love and Beauty, on Lyanna's lap. This action was considered an outrage by many because not only was Rhaegar married but Lyanna was already betrothed to another man. At some point after these events, Lyanna was abducted by Rhaegar, who took her south and hid her away in Dorne. Brandon, who had been on his way to Riverrun to wed Catelyn Tully, instead went to King's Landing to demand Rhaegar's arrest and punishment. King Aerys II Targaryen had him and all his companions charged with treason. He demanded all their fathers, including Lord Rickard Stark, come to King's Landing and promised they would receive a fair trial. Instead the King had them all burned alive, except for Brandon, who strangled himself trying to save his father.
This incident sparked the uprising known as Robert's Rebellion. Jon Arryn was commanded to arrest and turn over his wards Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark, but he refused. The three of them rose in rebellion along with Hoster Tully of Riverrun after Eddard and Jon married his daughters, Catelyn and Lysa. The war saw House Targaryen almost completely destroyed and Robert installed as king after he personally slew Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident. During the war Lyanna died from childbirth in Eddard's arms, after her rescue. As per her request, she was buried next to her brother Brandon in the crypts at Winterfell. Robert continued to mourn her despite becoming king and marrying Cersei Lannister. Though Eddard was angered at Robert for refusing to hold Tywin Lannister and his army accountable for the Sack of King's Landing, their friendship was rekindled over the mutual grief for Lyanna. Lyanna's death was revealed to be from complications from giving birth to her son, Jon Snow, whose father is Rhaegar. Her death was witnessed by Ned and two handmaidens and most likely Howland Reed. Before her death, Lyanna asks Ned to promise to keep her son safe from Robert, who would have the child killed if he found out Rhaegar was the father. Ned complies with Lyanna's wish and takes the infant to Winterfell. Fulfilling his promise, Ned says the boy is his bastard son, and named him Jon Snow. Few know the truth of Jon's parentage; with Ned, Howland and the two handmaidens being the only individuals bearing the knowledge.","","6, 7","",Deceased,Died giving birth to Jon Snow,Winterfell,House Stark,Northmen,Old Gods of the Forest,"","",Rickard Stark,"","",Jon Snow,"Brandon Stark, Eddard StarkBenjen Stark","",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/dc/Adult_Lyanna_Stark_%28brightened_image%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161215030843,Lyanna Stark,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a5/Robert_and_Lyanna.jpg,Lyanna is betrothed to Robert Baratheon.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b7/Lyanna_and_Rhaegar.jpg,Lyanna is taken by Rhaegar Targaryen.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c3/Lyanna_funeral.jpg,Lyanna is buried in the tomb beneath Winterfell.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/17/Winter_is_Coming_Robert_crypt.jpg,Robert Baratheon visits Lyanna's grave.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/38/Lyanna%27s_statue.jpg,The statue at Lyanna's grave in Winterfell.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/09/Home_01.jpg,Bran and the Three-eyed raven observe a young Lyanna with her brothers Eddard and Benjen in Winterfell.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d4/S06E10_-_Jon%2C_Ned_and_Lyanna.png,Ned receives Jon on Lyanna's deathbed.,House Stark

Viserys I Targaryen,"Viserys I Targaryen, is an unseen character. He is not expected to appear in the series, being long dead by the time it begins.
Viserys I was the first King of his name to sit on the Iron Throne and the fifth king of the Targaryen dynasty to rule the Seven Kingdoms. He was an ancestor of Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen. He was formally styled Viserys of House Targaryen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
Viserys I was the grandson of King Jaehaerys I, and father of Rhaenyra and Aegon II.","Viserys I was the grandson of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen. He immediately succeeded his grandfather as king because Jaehaerys I ruled for so long that his son (Viserys I's father) predeceased him. His rule was marked by peace, and the rule of House Targaryen was largely uncontested, with the exception of Dorne, although it is believed that this was thanks to Jaehaerys' work during his reign. According to Grand Maester Munkun however, Viserys did not squander the progress made under his predecessor.
His first wife Aemma Arryn, who was much younger than Viserys, was unable to give Viserys a son, only a daughter (Rhaenyra Targaryen). After his wife's death, he married Alicent Hightower, who gave him two sons, Aegon II and Aemond Targaryen, and one daughter, (Helaena Targaryen). When he became older, his health began to deteriorate. On his deathbed, he refused to change the succession, and proclaimed Rhaenyra as Queen. Unbeknownst to him, his court had split up into two groups, the Greens. who supported Aegon's claim, and the Blacks, who supported Rhaenyra's. These colors were so named because Alicent wore green and Rhaenyra wore black at a tourney.
One night, Viserys was found to have died in his sleep by a servant. This servant told Alicent of this, this proved to be a grave mistake, as Alicent proclaimed Aegon as King, which led to a rebellion led by Rhaenyra, which would later be known as the Dance of the Dragons.","",1,"King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm",Deceased,"","Red Keep, King's Landing",House Targaryen,"","",Jaehaerys I Targaryen,Aegon II Targaryen,"","","Aemma Arryn (1st wife), Alicent Hightower (2nd wife)","with Aemma:, Rhaenyra Targaryenwith Alicent:, Aegon II Targaryen, Helaena Targaryen, Aemond Targaryen",Daemon TargaryenRhaenys Targaryen,"",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a8/Viserys_I_Death.png/revision/latest?cb=20160723195147,Viserys I Targaryen,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/eb/Histories_%26_Lore%D7%83_The_Dance_of_Dragons_02.png,Viserys on his deathbed.,"","","","","","","","","","","","",House Targaryen

Robert Baratheon,"King Robert I Baratheon is a major character in the first season. He is played by starring cast member Mark Addy, and debuts in the series premiere.
Robert Baratheon was the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, formally styled as Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
Robert, a great warrior and charismatic man in his youth, took the throne through conquest in the war known as Robert's Rebellion, which began when the Prince of Dragonstone, Rhaegar Targaryen, allegedly abducted Robert's betrothed, Lyanna Stark. Killing Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident, his climactic duel turned the tides of the war in his favor. After the war and following Lyanna's death, Robert married Cersei Lannister to cement an alliance with House Lannister to hold the kingdoms together, but the marriage was loveless.
Robert and Cersei have three children: Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen. However, unbeknownst to Robert and most of the realm, all three were actually fathered by Cersei's twin brother, Jaime Lannister. On the other hand, Robert had many bastards from other women.","Robert was the first son of Steffon Baratheon and Cassana Baratheon, and has two younger brothers, Renly and Stannis. Steffon was the head of House Baratheon and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. The Stormlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Baratheon is one of the Great Houses of the realm. His parents died in his youth when their ship was caught in a storm; Robert, standing on the walls of Storm's End with Stannis, witnessed his parents ship that was returning from Essos break up on the rocks. He inherited the lordship, and was fostered by Jon Arryn, the head of House Arryn, another Great House. Eddard Stark, the second son of House Stark, was also fostered by Jon Arryn and Robert and Eddard became as close as brothers. Robert served King Aerys II Targaryen (known as the Mad King) as the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. Robert was betrothed to Lyanna Stark, Eddard's sister. At the time of their betrothal, Robert bet Richard Lonmouth during the tourney at Harrenhal.
However, Lyanna was alleged kidnapped by Rhaegar Targaryen. The Mad King had Eddard's father and brother killed for protesting against the kidnapping. Their deaths sparked a massive uprising against Aerys led by Robert, Eddard and Jon Arryn. Lyanna and Aerys died during the civil war that followed. Robert claimed the Iron Throne because he started the war and killed Prince Rhaegar personally. Robert also had the best claim to the throne as a result of being related to the Targaryens through his mother. The other leaders of the rebels, Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark, believed that Robert, with his claim and charismatic personality, should be king and both stood aside.
Robert was devastated by Lyanna's death, but was urged by Jon Arryn to marry Cersei of House Lannister, making an alliance with her father, Tywin Lannister, who had joined his cause late in the conflict and delivered the capital of King's Landing to him. He named Jon Arryn as his Hand while Eddard took his father's role as Warden of the North.
Stannis fought for Robert through the war though the two brothers never loved each other. Robert tells Eddard Stark ""You were the brother I chose."" Despite Stannis's service during the war, Robert made Renly the Lord of Storm's End following his victory. Renly was only a child during the war, so he did not fight. Stannis was made Lord of Dragonstone and served on Robert's small council as Master of Ships. Renly later joined the small council as Master of Laws.
Robert has been the King of the Andals and the First Men and the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros since the end of the civil war. However, he was more interested in drinking, whoring and hunting than ruling his kingdom. He revels in the glory days of the rebellion. He leaves running the kingdom largely to his small council, led by Jon Arryn.
King Robert also loves to throw events such as tournaments at which he spares no expense. Unfortunately, after seventeen years Robert's excesses have left the realm deeply in debt for a shocking six million Gold Dragons, half to House Lannister. He apparently has three children with Cersei: Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen. Unbeknownst to Robert, all three were actually fathered by Cersei's twin brother Jaime Lannister. Robert has also fathered several illegitimate bastards, to whom he pays no attention. He has an unacknowledged bastard son named Gendry fathered on a tavern wench. He has an unacknowledged bastard daughter named Barra fathered on the prostitute Mhaegen. He has at least four other unacknowledged bastards fathered with various women in the city of King's Landing alone.
Jon Arryn began investigating the lineage of Cersei's children, comparing their appearance to Robert's bastard offspring. He died under mysterious circumstances shortly after beginning his investigation. Robert has decided to ride north to Eddard's keep Winterfell to name him as Jon Arryn's replacement.","Robert Baratheon, as a young man, possessed the typical talent for warfare and leadership as his brothers, as expected of Baratheon men. He was a charismatic and fearsome military commander and a formidable warrior, shown by his famous defeat of Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident, pending the death of Aerys Targaryen. Robert was considered a very good man at heart, and he ultimately was, but people often couldn't see this because externally he appeared to be a brutal, heavy-drinking party animal. He had a fondness for strong drinks, women, tourneys and for extravagant parties, which he heavily immersed himself in after the end of his Rebellion against the Mad King- perhaps to drown his grief over having lost Lyanna. People often commented derogatorily that he was a drunken fool, and failed sometimes to see past his powerful temper.
Admittedly, however, Robert proved to be a poor peacetime ruler; a soldier more than anything else, he understood nothing about administration, frequently ignoring the sound advice his Small Council gave him. He showed some good judgement by choosing Jon Arryn and later Eddard Stark as Hand, but then unintentionally undermined their good administration with his reckless spending on luxuries and entertainments, which eventually bankrupted the Seven Kingdoms and forced him to take loans from the Iron Bank of Braavos and the Lannisters.
Robert's relationship with Eddard Stark brought out the better side of Robert. Since he did not have a particular fondness or relationship with either one of his actual brothers, he considered the Stark lord a surrogate brother. Ned was the only person who could genuinely counsel Robert on any subject, and the only person he appeared to want to listen to, since he seemed extremely impatient with anybody else. Robert trusted Ned deeply and had a very strong sense of empathy and reason for him. In addition to this, Robert had a deep personal love for Lyanna Stark, Ned's sister, and often lamented about her death, but this lamenting often gave way to Robert intensely tirading about his hatred for the Targaryens - he called Rhaegar Targaryen a monster and scorned him for raping Lyanna, and even after he had vanquished Rhaegar on the Trident, his brutal hatred of the surviving Targaryens. Robert's love for Lyanna went to such a vast extent that, on their wedding night, he visited Cersei in their bed (critically drunk) and openly mistook her for Lyanna, showing that he was unable to accept that Lyanna was apart from him. However, it is currently unknown whether or not Robert's love for Lyanna was just physical, or if there were feelings and true love involved.
Despite plunging into the temptations of drinking, feasting, gambling and suchlike, Robert Baratheon was not a stupid man in some respects. Even years after his climactic rebellion and his famous defeat of Rhaegar Targaryen, Robert still had a sound mind when it came to military matters; he was still able to precisely recite the strategies of the Dothraki if they invaded and provided statistical arguments as to why the Dothraki, with Viserys Targaryen as the figurehead, would eventually gain the upper hand. He was also able to recognize and lament for his mistakes, and apologized to Joffrey that he had never been a particularly good parent. He also, on his deathbed, begged for Eddard to help him in some way that Robert himself had been unable to.",1,"King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, Lord of Storm's End (formerly), Lord Paramount of the Stormlands (formerly)",Deceased,"Mortally wounded by a wild boar after drinking wine given to him by Lancel Lannister, on the orders of Cersei Lannister",Storm's End,"House Baratheon, House Baratheon of King's Landing",Andal,Faith of the Seven,"Steffon Baratheon (Lord Paramount of the Stormlands), Aerys II Targaryen (King of the, Andals and the First Men)","Renly Baratheon (Lord Paramount of the Stormlands), Joffrey Baratheon (King of the, Andals and the First Men)",Steffon Baratheon,Cassana Baratheon,Cersei Lannister,"Bastard children:, Gendry, Barra, 17 other bastard childrenTrueborn children:, Unnamed child by CerseiLegal children, fathered by Jaime Lannister:, Joffrey Baratheon, Myrcella Baratheon, Tommen Baratheon","Stannis Baratheon, Renly Baratheon","Mhaegen, Many unnamed lovers and, mistresses",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d4/RobertBaratheon.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141119000127,Robert Baratheon,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a5/Robert_and_Lyanna.jpg,Lyanna and her father Lord Rickard Stark with Robert Baratheon.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c3/Lyanna_funeral.jpg,Robert Baratheon mourns at the funeral of Lyanna Stark.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/22/Robert_slays_Rhaegar.jpg,Robert Baratheon slays Rhaegar Targaryen at the Battle of the Trident.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c8/Robert_Cersei_wedding.jpg,King Robert marries Cersei Lannister.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f3/Robert_at_Winterfell.jpg,"Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn show respect to King Robert in ""Winter is Coming"".",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/38/Lyanna%27s_statue.jpg,Lyanna's statue in Winterfell's crypts,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/46/Robert%27s_hunting_party.jpg,"King Robert Baratheon, Renly, the King's squire Lancel Lannister, and Barristan Selmy at the hunt.",House Baratheon

Aemon,"Maester Aemon is a recurring character in the first, third, fourth and fifth seasons. He is played by guest star Peter Vaughan and debuts in ""Lord Snow.""
Aemon is the maester at Castle Black and is one of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont's closest advisers in the Night's Watch.
He was born Aemon Targaryen and is the last known Targaryen in Westeros. He is the great-uncle of Daenerys Targaryen, who is unaware of his existence, and unknown to him, he is the great-great uncle of Jon Snow. Aemon's origins have long been forgotten by most, as he has remained dedicated to his vows as a Maester and a brother of the Night's Watch for many decades. ","Aemon was born into the royal House Targaryen, the second son of King Maekar I. Unlike the majority of his forbears, Aemon and his brothers were not born out of marriage between brother and sister. Their father and grandfather respectively married Dyanna of House Dayne and Myriah of House Martell. Originally known as Prince Aemon Targaryen, he was not his father's eldest son, so he eventually joined the order of Maesters. Aemon gave up all rights to inheritance when he took his vows, which also included relinquishing his surname ""Targaryen"".
Aemon's older brother, Aerion, later died, however, and despite being a sworn maester there were those who felt that the crown should pass to him. Aemon refused the throne, however, and it passed to his younger brother, who became King Aegon V. Aemon then joined the Night's Watch to remove himself from the political intrigues of the royal court and from those who wished to set him up as a rival against his brother.
Many years later, Aegon V died in the Tragedy at Summerhall and the crown passed to his son, Aemon's nephew Aerys II, who later became known as ""The Mad King"". Aerys's growing insanity ultimately led to the outbreak of Robert's Rebellion, which saw House Targaryen deposed and practically exterminated. Upon hearing about the brutal deaths of his family in King's Landing during the rebellion, Aemon bore great sadness which never left him.
Around one hundred years old, Aemon is thought to be one of the oldest living men in Westeros, though he has retained all of his wits and his mind is still very sharp. He has served as the maester at Castle Black for many decades.
Aemon has long since gone blind due to old age. It is not clear when he went blind (he was not born blind), though he has stated that he was already old and blind during Robert's Rebellion. As a man of learning, he laments not being able to read anymore, even though Castle Black ironically has an ancient and well-stocked library consisting of thousands of books. Because one of a maester's basic duties is to handle messages sent to and from a castle by messenger-ravens, Aemon has to rely on the assistance of others to physically read the letters for him.","","1, 3, 4, 5","Maester, Prince (formerly)",Deceased,"Died peacefully in his bed, from old age","Red Keep, King's Landing",Night's Watch,Valyrian,"","","",Maekar Targaryen,Dyanna Dayne,"","","Aerion Targaryen, Aegon V Targaryen","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/32/Aemonepisode5.png/revision/latest?cb=20150511170352,Aemon,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/93/Aemon-Castle-Black.jpg,Aemon has served as the maester of Castle Black for decades.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a9/Aemon_1x09.jpg,Aemon advises Jon Snow.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/71/AemonDictatesALetterToSam.png,Aemon with Samwell Tarly and Gilly at Castle Black.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7c/Aemon_part_of_jon_s_judging.jpg,Aemon with Alliser and Janos during Jon's judging.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e1/Aemon_in_library.png,Aemon in the library with Sam.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/01/Aemon_speech.png,Aemon delivering a eulogy before burning the dead.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/98/Gilly_Aemon_The_Gift_.jpg,Gilly tends to Maester Aemon on his death bed.,""

When Talisa was 12, her parents went to a wedding which lasted several days and left her with her younger brother. The second day they were gone was the hottest day in Volantis, so she and her brother joined the other children to go for a swim in the River Rhoyne. While she was talking with a friend, she noticed that her brother was missing. Eventually, she found him floating face down in the water. Talisa and her friend pulled him to the shore but he was dead. Suddenly, a man with a tattoo of a fish on his face (marking him as a fishing boat slave) came and pushed her away. Had she reported him, it would have meant death for the slave for touching a noble. The slave kept pushing down on her brother's chest again and again until he was revived.

While his unethical experiments have led to him being reviled, they also made him arguably one of the most talented healers in all of Westeros.","","3, 4, 5, 6, 7","Hand of the Queen (to Cersei I), Master of Whisperers (to Tommen I and Cersei I)",Alive,"","","House Lannister, House Baratheon of King's, Landing","","","Varys (as Master of Whisperers), Kevan Lannister (as Hand of the King)","","","","","","","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/00/Qyburn-S5.png/revision/latest?cb=20150420170635,Qyburn,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f0/Qyburn_expulsion.png,Qyburn is expelled from The Citadel.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/2c/Jaime-and-Qyburn-s3.jpg,Qyburn tends to Jaime's stump.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/89/Qyburn_in_Season_4.jpg,Qyburn offers to treat Gregor Clegane for Cersei.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/47/Gregor_and_qyburn.jpg,Qyburn begins working on Gregor.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/06/Qyburn_%28S05E03%29.jpg,Qyburn writing a letter to Petyr Baelish at the request of Cersei Lannister.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a5/Qyburn_and_Pycelle.jpg,Qyburn aids Cersei in killing Maester Pycelle.,"","",House Lannister
Gregor Clegane,"Ser Gregor Clegane is a recurring character in the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. He was originally played by guest star Conan Stevens and debuts in ""Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things."" Stevens was replaced by Ian Whyte, who had already appeared in the series in other roles, for the second season. In the fourth, fifth and sixth seasons he is portrayed by Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson.
Gregor is the head of House Clegane, the older brother of Sandor Clegane, and a notoriously fearsome warrior, with a tendency toward extreme and at times excessive violence. Due to his freakishly huge size, he is called ""The Mountain That Rides"" or more often simply ""The Mountain"".","Ser Gregor Clegane is the head of House Clegane, a knightly house from the Westerlands, and the elder brother of Sandor Clegane. When Sandor and Gregor were children, Gregor held his brother's face in a fire for using his toys without permission, horrifically scarring him. Gregor is a landed knight rather than a full-fledged lord. Gregor is freakishly huge, said to be the largest man in Westeros, almost eight feet in height and heavily muscled. He is feared throughout Westeros with a reputation for ferocity and anger. He is a loyal retainer and servant of House Lannister, particularly to Lord Tywin.
Numerous servants have gone missing at the Clegane keep over the years, apparently killed by Gregor for minor slights in one of his infamous rages, and their deaths then hushed up. Gregor's own father and sister died under dubious circumstances as well, and Sandor half-suspects that Gregor may have killed them as well. Their sister died when Sandor was too young to remember her well, and their father died years later in what was said to be a ""hunting accident"". At the behest of Tywin Lannister, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen himself anointed Gregor as a knight, a great honor, even though Gregor was an infamously dishonorable man.
During Robert's Rebellion, one year after Prince Rhaegar knighted him, Gregor participated in the Sack of King's Landing. After entering the Red Keep he viciously killed Rhaegar's two children by Elia Martell: their daughter Rhaenys and baby Aegon. He killed baby Aegon by bashing his head against the wall, and then while still covered in the gore from her children proceeded to rape Elia, after which he killed her. It is rumored that he killed her by cutting her in half with a single swing of his massive sword, although he later claimed to have ""smashed her head in"".
Despite pleas by Ned Stark, neither Gregor nor Tywin were punished by King Robert for the murders of the royal family, leading to a rift in Ned and Robert's friendship.","Gregor is well-known for his brutal and savage nature, remorselessly killing unarmed opponents half his size or leading the torture of helpless villagers. Often referred to as ""Tywin Lannister's mad dog"", Gregor has an insatiable bloodlust that he releases through acts of extreme violence. He is quick to anger and never shows any fear of acting on it, since no one dares stop him. One of the only people he has ever shown any loyalty or respect toward is Tywin; when not actively obeying Tywin's orders he mostly acts of his own accord, showing even little respect toward King Robert Baratheon after he was told to stop his fit of rage at the Tourney of The Hand. Gregor is also loyal to Qyburn and Cersei, following the experiments performed on him to prevent his death. His violent personality had even manifested as a child, quickly becoming known for his strength, size, and brutality. Gregor even burned his own brother's face when they were children simply for playing with one of Gregor's toys. Tywin suggests that Gregor is also an alcoholic, when instructing Arya Stark to keep Gregor from getting drunk.
Gregor's short fuse and utter lack of a conscience often showed his lack of honor, such as when he tried to murder Loras Tyrell after already losing a joust against him. In addition, Gregor does not appear to be very bright, relying solely on his physical instincts to get the job done without thinking of the long-term consequences, shown when he furiously bellows out for all to hear that he in fact did commit arguably his most infamous war crime while murdering Oberyn Martell, unaware that until then it was merely a rumor and will have severe consequences if the truth were to come out. Robb Stark describes Gregor as a ""mad dog without a strategic thought in his head"", while Jaime Lannister quips that Gregor had difficulties understanding complete sentences. It is ironic that it is Sandor Clegane who is nicknamed 'The Hound' when Sandor is at least capable of logical speculation and common sense, and it is Gregor who is at the absolute mercy of his animalistic rages and impulses.
As a warrior, Gregor is feared for his imposing size and physical strength. In combat, his strength gives him a huge advantage over almost any opponent, which allows him to defeat men who have far more skill. His weapon of choice is an enormous great sword that most men would never be able to swing with even two hands, but which Gregor is strong enough to wield one-handed. He is strong enough to decapitate a horse with a single swing of his sword, as seen during his joust with Loras Tyrell. Gregor also wears armor larger and thicker than normal knights would be able to wear, providing him almost impenetrable defense against his opponents. However, his brother Sandor Clegane (who is also very large and strong, though not to the same extent as Gregor) was shown to be able to duel him evenly. In addition, Gregor's lack of technical skill allowed Oberyn Martell to overwhelm him in their duel, as Oberyn's unique style of combat relied heavily on maneuverability and he used a spear to stay out of Gregor's reach. 
Following being poisoned by Oberyn's Manticore venom, Gregor is experimented on by Qyburn to keep him from death. The process changes Gregor as was expected. It is unclear whether he is truly alive or not. The Mountain becomes a ""new"" man and now part of Cersei's guard. Other than his soulless eyes and black, partially decayed flesh visible through his helmet, he can not be seen under his full body armor, however, his face is seen in the Red Keep dungeons after he is instructed to remove his helmet by Cersei. Whatever he is now, he is completely in service to Cersei (and Qyburn), and serves them in silence. Qyburn claims that he has vowed not to speak until King Tommen's enemies and all evil are gone from the realm. It is at least as likely that he is no longer capable of speech, not that he spoke much before anyway. Furthermore, it appears that far from weakening him, the process Qyburn subjected Ser Gregor to has made him even stronger than he once was. He is now capable of ripping a man's head off with his bare hands almost effortlessly.","1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7","Ser, Castellan of Harrenhal (formerly)",Alive,"",Clegane's Keep,"House Lannister, House Clegane, Kingsguard",Andal,"","","","","","","",Sandor Clegane,"",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/fe/GregorClegane-Profile.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160706014036,Gregor Clegane,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1a/Knighting.png,Gregor is knighted by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4a/Slaughter.png,Gregor about to murder Rhaegar's family.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a8/Gregor_Clegane_in_armor.png,Ser Gregor in full armor at the Tourney of the Hand.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/46/Tywin_and_Gregor.jpg,Gregor with Tywin Lannister at Harrenhal.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/cc/TheMountainMockingbird.jpg,Clegane is called upon to fight by Cersei Lannister.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/34/The_Viper_vs_the_Mountain3.jpg,The Mountain battles Oberyn Martell to the death.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/25/Game-Of-Thrones-Oberyns-crushed-head-and-wounded-Mountain.jpg,The Mountain crushes Oberyn's skull with his bare hands.,House Lannister

He suffered from a severe case of gout, which mostly prevented him from walking and restricted him to a wheelchair.
Unlike his more hotheaded and aggressive brother, Oberyn, Doran was a pensive, calculating, and patient man who always waited and observed before making his next move. Despite their different personalities, the two brothers were very close. While Oberyn could indulge in the wayward Dornish ways, challenging whomever he liked regardless of the consequences, Doran was raised to be more responsible as the heir to the Dornish throne.

However, this was often against their wishes, and this resulted in his becoming an unpopular ruler.
Doran had also been a witness to war and was deeply marked by its consequences. As such, he often tried to find a solution that avoided waging war, even if the honor of House Martell had been offended.

The featurette does show the grape-vine sigil of House Redwyne when she appears.","When Ser Brynden Tully returned from the War of the Ninepenny Kings he was hailed as a hero of the conflict, but his older brother Lord Hoster Tully greeted him with a marriage betrothal he had contracted on his behalf, in which Brynden would marry Bethany Redwyne. Brynden openly admitted that it was a good match and an opportunity for House Tully to ally with a very rich House.
However, Brynden refused to take part in the marriage, saying at the time that he would not simply be told when and whom to marry. From Hoster's point of view, many Tullys in past generations had been asked to do their duty for the good of the House and enter into arranged marriages to secure powerful alliances: even Brynden did not deny that it was a good match, but nonetheless refused to further the fortunes of his family. This led to a severe argument between the two brothers that would last much of the rest of their lives. Hoster called Brynden the ""black goat"" of the Tully herd, but considering their family's heraldry of a silver trout, Brynden joked that it would be more apt to say he was the black fish of the Tully school - the nickname stuck with Brynden ever since, and he even took a black trout as his personal sigil.
Brynden somewhat rued his decision years later during Robert's Rebellion: House Redwyne controls one of the largest fleets in Westeros, based at the Arbor, and this could have been added to the rebels' side. Instead, the Redwynes stayed loyal to the Targaryens.","","","",Alive,"",The Arbor,House Redwyne,Andal,"","","","","","","","","",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/ae/Bethany_Redwyne.png/revision/latest?cb=20140220002819,Bethany Redwyne,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also according to legend, it is said he aided Durran with the construction of Storm's End. After a thousand years of war in the North, House Stark eventually took control over the land.

Robin Arryn,"Lord Robin Arryn, commonly called ""Sweetrobin"" by his mother, is a recurring character in the first, fourth, fifth and sixth seasons. He is played by guest star Lino Facioli and debuts in ""The Wolf and the Lion"". Lord Robin Arryn is the only surviving child and heir of Lord Jon Arryn by his wife, Lysa of House Tully. He is the Lord of the Eyrie, the head of House Arryn, the Warden of the East and Lord Paramount of the Vale of Arryn. His mother was killed by Petyr Baelish in ""Mockingbird"" when he unexpectedly pushed her out of the Moon Door, falling hundreds of feet to her death. Petyr is left the acting Lord Paramount of the Vale as Robin's stepfather.",Robin was born in King's Landing where his father was serving as the Hand of the King for Robert Baratheon. Jon begins an investigation into Robert's legitimate and bastard children and then takes a fever and dies suddenly. Robin then inherits Jon's position. Lysa rushes Robin back to the Eyrie following Jon's death. She writes to her sister to accuse House Lannister of poisoning Jon. Lysa was fiercely protective of Robin hence he has led an extremely sheltered life.,"For the bulk of his life, Robin was shamelessly spoiled by his delusional, paranoid mother, and this resulted in him possessing few of the traits expected of the heir to a powerful noble house; aside from showing precious little tact or resolve, Robin became extremely temperamental, prone to hysterical fits and violent tempers. He also appears hugely entertained by the prospect of throwing prisoners and enemies through the Moon Door, giggling and clapping excitedly when it was opened for Tyrion Lannister. In that same vein, he appeared disappointed when robbed of the opportunity to see Tyrion executed. These traits do not make Robin psychopathic or sadistic to the standards of Joffrey Baratheon, Ramsay Bolton, or the Sand Snakes; he simply felt safe knowing that he could just send any problem that came his way plummeting to its death. Lysa's unnatural doting over her son did not go unnoticed by the boy’s father Jon Arryn, who was only obstructed from doing anything about it by Lysa's extreme overprotectiveness.
By the time he meets Sansa Stark, Robin appears to have improved very minutely, but still maintains his capacity for tantrums, throwing an impractical temper when Sansa accused him of ruining her snow-built Winterfell (he believed it had already been ruined simply on the basis that it didn't have a Moon Door), not accounting for the fact that Winterfell was her home and the one place she yearned to be. Petyr Baelish observed that the strike she dealt him during the argument was something his mother should have administered a long time ago.
Robin seems have a limited vocabulary – he refers to executions as 'seeing people fly' – and appears to be intellectually stunted, incapable of long-term logical thinking because he never truly had to face difficult decisions in his life. He is often easily distracted, and in struggles to come to conclusions that were logically and ethically obvious to everyone else (such as helping Sansa during the impeding battle with Ramsay Bolton).  
Because of Lysa's prolonged, unnatural doting, Robin is also weak, sickly, and overall physically unsatisfactory for a boy his age. While training under Lord Royce at Runestone, Robin was shown to be hopeless with a sword, and even after prolonged training he can't even strike the widest ring on an archery target, struggling to hold a bow stably in his hands. By contrast, even Joffrey could handle a sword better than Robin could (which is saying a great deal).  ","1, 4, 5, 6, 7","Lord of the Eyrie, Lord Paramount of the Vale, Warden of the East",Alive,"","King's Landing (birthplace), The Eyrie (raised)",House Arryn,Andal,"",Jon Arryn,"",Jon Arryn,Lysa Arryn,"","","","",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/74/Robin_Aaryn_Book_of_Stranger.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160714005525,Robin Arryn,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4d/Lysa_and_Robin.png,Lysa dotes over her son.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/70/Robin_MD.jpg,Robin throws his gift through the Moon Door.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e2/501_Sweetrobin_training_at_Runestone.jpg,Robin training at Runestone.,"","","","","","","","",House Arryn

Drogon,"Drogon is one of the dragons born in the Dothraki Sea, along with Viserion and Rhaegal. He is named after Daenerys' late husband Khal Drogo. He is distinguishable by his black and red colored scales, and red-black wings. He is the largest and most aggressive of the three hatchlings.","","Drogon is slightly larger than his siblings. Most of his scales are black, shadowing red ones that run down his back and neck. His wings and frills are black-red mix, down to the wing-bones which are black. His eyes are orange-red.
Over the course of the series he has grown considerably, from being roughly the size of a kitten in Season 1 to the size of a small whale in Season 6.
Drogon is the least shy of the three dragons when it comes to interacting with humans, albeit for the worst. He is by far the most aggressive of the three, easily agitated and quick to anger, as seen when he is a juvenile and he snarled at a Yunkai wise master when he approached his mother. He is also the first to react to orders and takes the initiative in confrontations, as seen when Daenerys ordered her dragons to burn Pyat Pree or when the Wise Master threatened her, he was the first to jump to his mother's defense. He often seeks his mother's affection, and is often seen being caressed by her. However, even she isn't safe from his anger, as seen when he snarled at her without warning when she tried to defuse a conflict between the three. That said, he is fiercely protective of his mother, and will fight viciously in order to defend her, ignoring wounds if needed, as seen when he attacked the Sons of the Harpy in the Pit. It appears that he can sense when Daenerys is in danger, and if he does, he will rush to her aide. His larger size also makes him take a dominant role among his siblings, shown in how easily he stole a lamb from Viserion and Rhaegal, the latter two not daring to fight but instead squealing for him to share.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","",Alive,"",Wastelands beyond Lhazar,Daenerys Targaryen,"","","","","","","","","","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/16/3578B2E600000578-3649770-image-m-146_1466402968569.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161228181117,Drogon,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/16/Dragon_Young_Drogon.jpg,A baby Drogon.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/ca/Drogon_5x02_infobox.jpg,"",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/ad/Dany_and_the_egg.jpg,Daenerys placing Drogon's egg into a brazier.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/dc/Drogon_breathes_fire.jpg,"Drogon, breathing fire for the first time.",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7f/Daenerys_and_dragons_2x10.png,Daenerys and her dragons use fire to kill and escape Pyat.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5f/Drogon_kills_Kraznys_S3E4.jpg,Drogon burns Kraznys during the Sack of Astapor.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/25/Dragons_S3E4.jpg,Daenerys marches forward with her army and dragons.,""

Meryn Trant,"Ser Meryn Trant is a recurring character in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth seasons, played by guest star Ian Beattie and debuting in ""The Pointy End"". Ser Meryn Trant is a knight of the Kingsguard under Kings Robert Baratheon, Joffrey Baratheon, and Tommen Baratheon.","Ser Meryn Trant is a member of House Trant, a vassal house to House Baratheon. He becomes a knight of the Kingsguard of Robert Baratheon after Robert's Rebellion. He is a successful tourney knight, though Sandor Clegane is scornful of Trant's skills, remarking that ""any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.""
He takes great pride in his status as a knight of the Kingsguard even though he routinely follows orders that break a knight's sworn duty to defend the weak and the innocent without hesitation or question.","Meryn Trant is pompous, cowardly, incompetent, vindictive and known for being a casually cruel man who follows any orders from the king no matter how ridiculous or unnecessary such as beating Sansa in plain view of the court to the disgust of Tyrion, Bronn, and the Hound. He also blindly follows orders from Cersei. Meryn is a superb example of what a knight of the Kingsguard should not embody: Meryn Trant is a man who wields his white cloak as a privilege to do whatever he wants, and would rather victimise the weak than help it, and would rather not take important matters into his own hands. A true knight of the Kingsguard would not raise a hand to the weak, would consider the white cloak as a personification of his duty and takes matters into his own hands, considering that he should be the most skilled man available in that situation. Trant is also a sycophant, blatantly praising Joffrey as a loved person and showing pompous 'loyalty' to Joffrey when Tyrion mocks the boy.
It is also heavily implied that he is a cowardly, weak and inept fighter due to not daring to speak again when Tyrion (figuratively) threatens to have him killed by Bronn, also having no qualms about combating Syrio Forel whilst in full armor whilst the latter is using a practice sword or abandoning Sansa to the angry mob during the Riot of King's Landing, using his loyalty to King Joffrey as a convenient excuse (which Sandor Clegane notes by quipping that any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants). This explains why he shows proclivity towards abusing women (notably those who can't retaliate, like Sansa), especially children (as confirmed by Tyrion when he described him as a ""pompous child-beater""). It is later observed that in private he is an hebephile who beats little girls and Sandor Clegane's assessment of his combat prowess is proven correct when Arya Stark successfully kills him with ease.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5",Ser,Deceased,Throat slit by Arya Stark,Gallowsgrey,"Kingsguard, House Trant",Andal,"","","","","","","","","",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/46/Ser_Meryn.png/revision/latest?cb=20140928135510,Meryn Trant,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/ae/Sansa_and_Meryn_1x10.png,Ser Meryn holds Sansa at King Joffrey's orders.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5b/Tyrion_and_Ser_Meryn_in_2x6.png,Ser Meryn Trant refuses to heed Tyrion's orders.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/51/Guards_S3_Ep1.jpg,Ser Meryn guards Cersei and Tyrion.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a2/Joffjaimeroom.jpg,"Meryn, Joffrey and Jaime discuss the wedding.",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/ba/Meryn.png,Meryn at Tyrion's trial.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c8/TrantBraavos.png,Meryn arrives in Braavos,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7d/Meryn-trant-death.png,Arya slits Meryn Trant's throat.,""

The two grew close, sharing food, drink, and women; when Gregor became lord he named Duncan his castellan. Many eyebrows were raised, but Duncan proved himself worthy and has served the House well in the many years since.","Throughout the game, Duncan displays great caring about the state and people of House Forrester, often giving Lord Ethan and Lord Rodrik advice without being asked. Many in House Forrester consider Duncan to be very wise: Lady Elissa Forrester recommends that Rodrik have Duncan accompany him over Ser Royland to a diplomatic meeting with their enemy, House Whitehill. However, Duncan becomes very angry when insulted. If Lord Ethan selects Ser Royland as Sentinel over him, he immediately declares, in front of the entire Small Council, that it is a ""poor choice"". Furthermore, in the event that Duncan is denied the office of Sentinel, he betrays Rodrik and becomes an informant for his enemy, Lord Whitehill.

Nymeria Sand,"Nymeria Sand, often called ""Nym"" for short, is a recurring character in the fifth, sixth and seventh seasons, and was first alluded to in the fourth season.

Nymeria is one of the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, the Sand Snakes.","Nymeria Sand is the second of the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, known as the ""Sand Snakes"". Nymeria's mother was an Eastern noblewoman, who taught her how to use a whip in combat, but who later died in battle. Nymeria became very skilled with using her 8 foot long bullwhip in combat.
Nymeria inherited her father's cunning, and is the most observant and calculating of the Sand Snakes. Instead of charging head-on into a situation relying on brute strength (like her older sister Obara), she will stand back and observe her enemy's weak points, then move in precisely for an accurate strike. In this, she is actually more like her uncle, Doran Martell, than like her father. Her choice of a bullwhip as her primary weapon exemplifies this mentality. She hones her reflexes by playing a sparring game with her younger sister Tyene, in which one slaps the other's hands before they can move them; Nymeria claims she has never lost this game.
Nymeria dresses more femininely than her martial sister Obara, though she is no less deadly. Nymeria has long flowing hair, and alluring Dornish-style dresses.
She is named after Nymeria, the warrior-queen of the Rhoynar who led her people's migration to Dorne one thousand years ago. The original Nymeria unified Dorne for the first time, and is considered the founder of House Martell in its modern form. ""Nymeria"" is a popular name in Dorne, much as ""Brandon"" is in the North, after their founder Brandon the Builder.

Nymeria,"Nymeria was the warrior-queen who led the Rhoynar refugees to Dorne a thousand years ago. She is an ancestor of House Martell, and is seen as the founder of Dorne as a unified realm under Martell rule.","The Rhoynar once lived in city-states along the Rhoyne River. About a thousand years ago (perhaps 700 years before the Targaryen Conquest), the Rhoynar were on the verge of being conquered by the expanding power of the Valyrian Freehold and its dragons. Defeated at the end of the Rhoynish Wars, Nymeria rallied the survivors and fled Essos altogether, sailing in a refugee fleet said to include ten thousand ships. After much wandering she eventually led her people to Dorne, at the southeastern tip of Westeros. After landing, Nymeria had all of the Rhoynar's 10,000 ships burned, so that none would have second thoughts about staying.
At the time, Dorne was divided into many petty kingdoms and had never been unified. Impressed by Nymeria, local king Mors Martell married her and united her forces with his own. Together, they conquered and unified all of Dorne for the first time, reigning from the Martell's seat at Sunspear. At some point later, she would marry Davos Dayne. Dorne was the last of the Seven Kingdoms to join the realm; however, it did not join through conquest, but rather through marriage two centuries later.
The Dornish revere Nymeria as the founder of their realm, and her descendants in House Martell continued to rule Dorne through the present day. As a result, ""Nymeria"" actually became a common name in Dorne (comparable to how ""Brandon"" is a very common name in the North, after their founder, Brandon Stark the Builder). Oberyn Martell - himself a direct descendant of Nymeria, warrior-queen of the Rhoynar - named one of his own bastard daughters Nymeria Sand. Nymeria's fame also spread across Westeros: even young Arya Stark, fascinated with legends about past warrior-queens, chose to name her direwolf ""Nymeria"".","","",Princess of Dorne,Deceased,"",Ny Sar,"House Martell, Rhoynar",Rhoynar,"",Mors Martell,Daughter,"","","Mors Martell, Davos Dayne","Daughter, Son","","",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/97/Nymeria_warrior_queen.png/revision/latest?cb=20150302195203,Nymeria,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/20/Nymeria_Ten_Thousand_Ships.png,Nymeria leading the Rhoynar refugee fleet in its migration to Westeros,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/99/Nymeria_and_Mors_Martell.png,"Local lord Mors Martell united his forces with Nymeria and her Rhoynar, to conquer and unify Dorne for the first time.",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0b/Nymeria_and_her_High_Lords.png,Nymeria with her High Lords,"","","","","","","","",House Martell

Later in the tourney, the Knight of the Laughing Tree defended Reed's honour by jousting and defeating the knights of the squires mentioned, and the only prize the mysterious knight asked for was that the defeated knights teach their squires honour.

Rhaegar Targaryen,"Prince Rhaegar Targaryen is an unseen character in Game of Thrones, being deceased when the events of the series commence. He was the eldest son and heir of King Aerys II Targaryen, holding the title of Prince of Dragonstone. Rhaegar was the older brother of Viserys and Daenerys, though Daenerys was born after he died. He was known to have won the affections of many, most notably Cersei Lannister. He was the last great champion of House Targaryen before his sister rose to power.
Rhaegar was blamed for starting Robert's Rebellion by abducting Lyanna Stark - though his reasons for taking her remain unknown - and he was killed by Robert Baratheon, Lyanna's betrothed, at the climax of the war. Rhaegar was the husband of Elia Martell and the father of her two children, Aegon and Rhaenys. In addition, he was the biological father of Jon Snow by Lyanna.","Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was the eldest son and heir to the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, by his sister/wife Queen Rhaella Targaryen. Tywin Lannister desired for his daughter Cersei to marry Rhaegar, but King Aerys II insulted Tywin by indicating that such a match would be beneath Rhaegar. Instead, Rhaegar was married to Princess Elia Martell of Dorne, with whom he had a daughter named Rhaenys and then a son named Aegon. In spite of Elia's love and loyalty to him, Rhaegar abducted Lyanna Stark of Winterfell for unknown reasons.
After the Mad King had both Lyanna's father Rickard and oldest brother Brandon brutally executed because the latter brazenly rode to the capital, demanding Rhaegar release Lyanna, her other brother, Eddard Stark, and her betrothed, Robert Baratheon, joined forces with several other houses to overthrow the Targaryen dynasty. This war became known as the War of the Usurper or Robert's Rebellion. After initially remaining away from the fighting in Dorne, Rhaegar was summoned to lead the Royalist forces in what would be the Battle of the Trident. Before he left Dorne however, he ordered Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Gerold Hightower to remain at the Tower of Joy to protect Lyanna, who at the time was expecting his child. During the Battle, Rhaegar was killed in single combat with Lyanna's betrothed Robert Baratheon in the midst of a spectacular duel. Rhaegar was struck down with a massive blow from Robert's warhammer, which scattered the rubies encrusted in Rhaegar's armor under the water. That location was named the ""Ruby Ford"" thereafter.
His father was killed shortly afterwards by Ser Jaime Lannister during the Sack of King's Landing and his mother died in childbirth at Dragonstone. His younger brother Viserys and sister Daenerys (who was born after Rhaegar's death) survived in exile in the Free Cities across the sea. Lyanna later died at the Tower of Joy after giving birth to Jon Snow.

He later falls in love with Daenery's advisor and handmaiden Missandei. Grey Worm then sails with Daenerys in order to reclaim the Iron Throne.

Refusing to surrender his family home to the Freys, he is killed in a final stand when Jaime Lannister retakes the castle.","Brynden Tully is the younger brother of Hoster Tully, Lord of Riverrun and head of House Tully, and the uncle of Catelyn Stark, Edmure Tully, and Lysa Arryn. Brynden is a respected knight and formidable battle commander, who first distinguished himself in the War of the Ninepenny Kings, nearly forty years before the War of the Five Kings.
Brynden often argued with his older brother Hoster, particularly over the fact that Brynden never married. When Brynden returned home from the War of the Ninepenny Kings, Hoster had already arranged for him to marry Bethany Redwyne, of the wealthy and powerful House Redwyne. Brynden refused this generous match, however, refusing to be told when and whom to marry. Hoster was angry that Brynden would not do his duty to their family and enter into a marriage-alliance to improve their fortunes, and said that he was the black goat of the Tully herd. Brynden joked that given that the Tully sigil is a trout, it would be more fitting to say that he was the ""black fish"" of the Tully school. The nickname stuck, and Ser Brynden became popularly known as ""The Blackfish"" ever since. Brynden even took to using a black fish in his own personal heraldry, which like the standard Tully heraldry it uses a red and blue background, but swaps out the normal silver trout for a black one. Hoster would attempt to contract other arranged marriage-alliances for Brynden over the years, many of them very promising matches, but Brynden turned down them all, which led to constant bickering between the two brothers throughout their lives.
Despite his disagreements with his brother over his refusal to marry, Brynden is very devoted to his family.","","3, 6","Ser, Acting Lord of Riverrun (formerly)",Deceased,Killed while fighting Lannister and Frey soldiers,Riverrun,House Tully,Andal,"","","","","","","",Hoster Tully,"",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/61/6x07_Blackfish.png/revision/latest?cb=20160601191023,Brynden Tully,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/bd/3x03_Brynden_Comforting_Catelyn.png,Brynden comforts Catelyn over the death of her father and the disappearances of her two younger sons.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/46/306_The_Laws_of_My_Fist.png,Brynden advises his nephew to marry Walder Frey's daughter.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/2f/309_Brynden_Red_Wedding.png,Brynden talks with Catelyn during Edmure's wedding.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/32/607_As_Long_as_I%27m_Standing.png,The Blackfish meets The Kingslayer.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/27/No_One_24.jpg,The Blackfish reads Sansa Stark's letter.,"","","","",House Tully

Lancel Lannister is the eldest son of Kevan Lannister and a nephew of Tywin Lannister. He serves as a squire for King Robert Baratheon until he is elevated to knighthood, but after sustaining heavy injuries during the Battle of the Blackwater, he joins the religious movement known as Sparrows and abandons his family name, after which he is simply known as Brother Lancel.","Lancel Lannister is the son of Ser Kevan Lannister and the nephew of Lord Tywin Lannister, the head of House Lannister and Lord of Casterly Rock. He is the first cousin of Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion Lannister. He has the familial blond hair and resembles his cousin Jaime. He is a squire to King Robert Baratheon.","When Lancel was young, he was shy, timid and extremely slow-witted, constantly falling for Robert Baratheon's harsh jokes and bowing before his fearsome tempers. He was not in any sense particularly intelligent, falling for Robert Baratheon's demands to find a breastplate-stretcher, despite the fact that common sense and logic alone hinted there was no such thing. He rarely spoke when he was with Robert except to offer him more wine, and to suffer his temper when there was no wine left. After Robert was killed in a hunt, which Lancel was partly responsible for, Lancel was knighted and this made him a tad bolder - more accurately, it made Lancel entitled, pompous, arrogant and melodramatic, speaking down to Tyrion as if he were a title superior to him and using his title as a knight in order to justify actions. He still remained timid and cowardly, falling to pieces at the prospect of Joffrey hearing about his encounters with Cersei.
Lancel's future experiences seemed to change slightly. Even after he was wounded and became slavishly devoted to the Faith Militant and the High Sparrow, he still maintained an arrogant and self-righteous attitude. With the rest of the Faith Militant to back him up, Lancel would repeatedly try to intimidate others regardless of these people being lords, priests or generally powerful people. He was also still rather timid, backing off slightly when faced with the Mountain. (Though this can be considered natural, since the Mountain frightens everyone). That being said, he was not incapable of being self-reproachful and he seemed to be genuinely apologetic about 'leading' Cersei on into their unlawful relationship, which is in stark contrast to when he literally was rendered speechless when confronted by Tyrion with the consequences of what he had done.","1, 2, 5, 6",Ser (formerly),Deceased,"Stabbed in the spine by Arthur, then incinerated by wildfire as, orchestrated by Cersei Lannister",Casterly Rock,"Sparrows, Faith Militant, House Lannister",Andal,Faith of the Seven,"","",Kevan Lannister,Dorna Lannister,"","","Martyn Lannister, Willem Lannister",Cersei Lannister (formerly),http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a5/No_One_09.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160609035744,Lancel Lannister,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3f/Lancel.jpg,Lancel serves King Robert I Baratheon.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/05/Cersei_and_Lancel.png,Lancel and Cersei make love.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7a/Lancel_spy.jpg,Lancel speaks with his cousin Tyrion Lannister.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/20/Sandor%26LancelS02XEP09.jpg,Lancel with Sandor Clegane during the Battle of Blackwater.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d0/Lancel_shot_2x09.jpg,Lancel is hit by an arrow during the Battle of Blackwater.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/ec/Lancel_Season_5_Episode_4.jpg,"Recovered from his injuries, Lancel joins the Sparrows.",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a7/Lancel-Blood-of-my-Blood.png,"Lancel at Baelor's Sept in ""Blood of My Blood"".",House Lannister

Lysa Arryn,"Lady Lysa Arryn, née Tully, is a recurring character in the first and fourth seasons. She is played by guest star Kate Dickie and debuted in ""The Wolf and the Lion."" Lysa was the Lady Regent of the Vale, ruling on behalf of her young son Robin Arryn. She doted on her son and pursued a policy of isolationism following her murder of her husband Jon Arryn, under the influence of Lord Petyr Baelish.","Lysa was born into House Tully and was the second child of Lord Hoster Tully. She had an older sister, Catelyn, and a younger brother, Edmure. Petyr Baelish was fostered with the Tullys and Lysa grew up with him.
Lysa married Jon Arryn during Robert's Rebellion. Lord Jon was the head of House Arryn and a leader of the rebel faction fighting to overthrow the Mad King. The rebels forged an alliance with House Tully through marriage, with Lord Eddard Stark married to Catelyn and the then-elderly Jon to the still young Lysa.
After the rebel victory in the war, Robert Baratheon became King and appointed Jon as his Hand. Jon served the realm well for many years as Hand of the King. Lysa and Jon have a single son, Robin Arryn, whom she dotes on constantly. Lysa and Jon spent the next seventeen years in the capital of King's Landing, never returning to the Eyrie in the Vale of Arryn.
Jon died shortly before the events of the series, sparking King Robert's search for a replacement. Lysa fled King's Landing for the safety of the Eyrie with Robin, then six-years old. Though Robin became the titular Lord Paramount of the Vale after his father's death, his mother in fact assumed rulership as the Lady Regent of the Vale until her son came of age. She is considered mentally unstable by Tyrion Lannister.","Lysa Arryn was characterised by her capacity for jealousy: she was unendingly jealous of her sister Catelyn for being the first choice in every matter that would have benefited either one of them, and for Lysa herself always landing with the second best option - her marriage to Jon Arryn, for instance, as opposed to Ned Stark. Her jealousy of her sister also led to her referring to Catelyn in diabolical terms. This led to Lysa being withdrawn, lonely, cold, apathetic, malignantly willful and subjective to fits of anger that were often unjustified, to the extent that she saw enemies in anyone who disagreed with her. Lysa's jealousy of Catelyn was completely typical, if not entirely overgrown, of sibling contempt; the younger sibling jealous of the opportunities and fortunes afforded to the older sibling simply on the basis that she is the older sibling rather than acknowledging that her sister's good fortune could be the result of hard work or luck.
She was, however, extremely unstable and temperamental to a fault. She had psychological issues that were famed but never narrowed down in terms of origins or cause. The most likely cause of her instability was her life of solitude and being second-benefited by everyone. She tended to go to incredible extremes in terms of her actions because of her instability - she loved her son Robin to such a dangerous degree that she had delusions about him being strong and diligent and gallant, when Robin was in fact weak, timid, spoiled and lacking in intellect or physical advantage (In stark contrast to the likes of Robb Stark). She wasn't as much protective of him, as she was protective over something that she could be proud of - proud, that is, for no logical reason other than her own delusions about his majesty.
The extremes of Lysa's emotions made her extremely violent and intensely aggressive, generally lightning-fast-to-anger. She was easily infuriated by any suggestion that intimidated her, or more accurately her peace of mind. She was so violent that she, in a fit of rage, tried to throw Sansa out of the Moon Door when Petyr kissed her, regardless of the logical evidence that Petyr kissed Sansa and Sansa was innocent in the matter, but Lysa's ego wouldn't let her accept this. She would also turn rather sadistic, to the point that she believed that throwing Tyrion (An innocent man, whom she perceived to be guilty based on her prejudice and the fact that he was a Lannister, one of the most powerful and dangerous Houses in Westeros) out of the Moon Door was elegance.
Lysa's arrogance and vicious inferiority complex was probably the most fatal element to her twisted and immoral character. She held such an amount of self-worth that she believed that she and Petyr Baelish would be a perfect couple based on her intense obsession with him. She believed that, though Petyr loved Catelyn, she loved him no more than the whores in his brothels and didn't even perceive him as an option for companionship. The almost poetic irony here is that Petyr held Lysa in precisely that same regard, in that he had no love for her and, when he confronted her at the Moon Door over the subject of who he loved, he was effortlessly able to lull her into a sense of security by claiming he loved only one woman all his life, and she believed it was her - her final expression before being thrown out of the Moon Door was shock and incredulity at it being Catelyn, before Petyr ruthlessly pushed her from her own Moon Door.","1, 4",Lady Regent of the Vale,Deceased,Fell to her death after being pushed out the Moon Door by Petyr Baelish,Riverrun,House Baelish,Andal,"","","",Hoster Tully,Minisa Tully,"Jon Arryn (1st husband), Petyr Baelish (2nd husband)",Robin Arryn,"Catelyn Stark, Edmure Tully","",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/46/LysaArryn.png/revision/latest?cb=20140523133128,Lysa Arryn,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/10/Lysa_Tully.png,Lysa shortly after her marriage to Jon Arryn.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4d/Lysa_and_Robin.png,Lysa dotes over her son.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3c/Lysa.jpg,Lysa accuses Bronn of fighting without honor.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/11/Lysa.png,Lysa refuses to send knights to aid her sister.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/95/Lysapetyr.png,Lysa is delighted by Petyr's arrival in the Eyrie.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/af/Sansalysa.png,"Lysa with her niece, Sansa Stark.",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/48/Lysafall.png,Lysa falls to her death.,""

Maekar's personal sigil was the normal Targaryen sigil, quartered, so that it repeated four times.","Maekar was a King in the Targaryen dynasty. Unlike the majority of their forbears, Maekar and his siblings - Baelor, Aerys I, Aelinor, and Rhaegel - were not born out of incestuous marriage. Instead, their father Daeron II and his sister Daenerys respectively wed Myriah and Maron Martell in order to unite Dorne with the Iron Throne. Since his only sister Aelinor married Aerys, Maekar wed another woman of Dornish nobility, Dyanna of House Dayne. He was the father of Aerion, who ultimately killed himself drinking wildfire, Aemon, who would become a Maester at Castle Black and a member of the Night's Watch; and Aegon V Targaryen, who would succeed him to the Iron Throne. Although he was the fourth son, Maekar would ultimately ascend the throne as his brothers either died or were skipped over due to the ""Targaryen madness"".

Alliser Thorne,"Ser Alliser Thorne is a recurring character in the first, fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons. He is played by guest star Owen Teale and debuts in ""Lord Snow."" He was originally announced as being played by Derek Halligan, but Halligan withdrew from the role before production began. Ser Alliser Thorne is the Master-at-Arms at Castle Black and is responsible for training new recruits to the Night's Watch.
After the Battle of Castle Black, Thorne loses the election to become the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, narrowly beaten by Jon Snow. The new Lord Commander names him the First Ranger, as a result of his experience and to appease his followers in the Watch. Thorne, however, betrays and leads and mutiny against Jon after he leads a mission to Hardhome to rescue the remaining wildlings, but after Jon is resurrected, Thorne is arrested and later hanged for his treason.","Ser Alliser Thorne is a member of the Night's Watch. He is from House Thorne, a noble house of the Crownlands sworn to the Iron Throne. He fought on House Targaryen's side during Robert's Rebellion, which ended in their defeat. Like many other Targaryen loyalists, the victorious rebels subsequently gave him a choice between execution or joining the Night's Watch.
During the last winter, Thorne and his ranger companions were trapped in a massive winter storm and had to resort to cannibalism to survive. Through seventeen years of able service, Thorne rose through the ranks of the officers in the Night's Watch to become the master-of-arms at Castle Black, responsible for training new recruits - a task he takes no joy in, as most recruits in recent generations tend to be petty criminals sent to the Wall as punishment.","Though Alliser Thorne is depicted as a stern, unsympathetic and sometimes cruel man, he is not inherently malicious or evil. His behavior and animosity towards Jon Snow and the other recruits of the Night's Watch appear to be due to his noble background and his distaste at how the Watch has become nothing more than a glorified penal colony. His resentment towards Jon stems from his dislike for Ned Stark, one of the rebels who brought down the Targaryen dynasty, which led to Tywin Lannister having him exiled to the Wall. Thorne has become a hardened and bitter person as a result, and does not tolerate weakness or cowardice, demonstrated when, for entertainment, humiliates Samwell Tarly in the courtyard, and shows anger at Jon protecting him, telling him that being soft will not help Sam and will only get him killed.
Despite his flaws, however, Thorne appears to be a fundamentally decent man, and most of his actions are dedicated towards protecting the Wall and the Seven Kingdoms against any threat from the lands beyond, no matter how unethical they may seem. He holds Maester Aemon and Qhorin Halfhand in high regard, outright admitting to Jon that he saw Qhorin as a brother, and valiantly leads the Night's Watch into battle against the wildlings and duels Tormund Giantsbane alone. Prior to the battle, he shares a moment with Jon and explains the difficulties of leadership to him, and does his best to encourage Jon to not lose heart, though this is possibly because he believed they were both about to die soon. Following Maester Aemon's funeral, he warns Sam that he is losing his friends, which could be his own gruff way of warning Sam of what is coming.
His dedication to his goal and his distrust for Jon are also what lead him to spark a mutiny against Jon: in his eyes, by letting the wildlings pass through the Wall into the Seven Kingdoms to avoid the coming White Walkers, Thorne believes that Jon has committed the ultimate betrayal towards the Night's Watch, since keeping the wildlings beyond the wall was the very cause that most of their sworn brothers bled and died for, which appears to depict him as somewhat shortsighted, given his hatred for the wildlings blinds him to the true danger approaching Westeros. Thus, he does not stab Jon out of spite or jealousy, but out of anger and grief for his slain comrades, hence his words, ""For the Watch"" (although the David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have hinted that Thorne's personal vendetta against Jon may have been a factor in his decision to mutiny against him).
In his final moments, Thorne contemplated that it wasn't a choice of betraying Jon or betraying his personal interest, but rather the latter meaning betraying the Night's Watch - Jon had brought the Wildlings from Beyond the Wall and broken a crucial element of the vow he took, and in Thorne's opinion that justified his execution. Despite this, Thorne admitted that he had ultimately lost the battle he was fighting, and calmly awaited his execution, believing it was finally his chance to 'rest' - however he still pointed out to Jon that the latter would be fighting their battles forever in Alliser's place.","1, 4, 5, 6","Ser, Master-at-Arms at Castle Black, First Ranger, Acting Lord Commander of the Night's Watch (formerly)",Deceased,Executed by hanging by Jon Snow for treason,"",Night's Watch,Andal,"","Jeor Mormont, Jon Snow","Jon Snow, Eddison Tollett","","","","","","",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/16/Game-of-thrones-season-6-owen-teale.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20160711235109,Alliser Thorne,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/45/Jon_and_Alliser_1x03.jpg,Alliser mocks Jon.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/66/AlliserThorneS4EP03.png,Alliser at Jon's trial.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/9c/ThorneSnow.jpg,Alliser and Jon about the wildlings,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/38/Thorne_hangs.png,Thorne is hanged.,"","","","","","",""

After the elimination of Harren and his entire line at the Burning of Harrenhal, Aegon rewarded Edmyn by elevating the Tullys to rule over the Riverlands (under the Targaryens), even though they had never ruled the Riverlands as kings - indeed, the Riverlands had been occupied by powerful neighboring kingdoms for centuries, and before that were rarely politically unified.

As a female and the only living heir of a major Northern house, Lyanna challenges and strives to live up to the expectations placed upon her, and behaves in a stern, no-nonsense manner when negotiating with other houses. She is extremely proud of her house, and she is devoted to protecting Bear Island's people, indicating that she views this responsibility with the utmost solemnity. Though Lyanna shares her family's fierce loyalty to House Stark, she was initially reluctant to help Jon and Sansa fight the Boltons until Ser Davos convinced her, comparing their recent rises to power and informing her of the greater threat beyond the Wall.","6, 7",Lady of Bear Island,Alive,"","Bear Island, the North","House Mormont, House Stark",Northmen,Old Gods of the Forest,Maege Mormont,"","",Maege Mormont,"","","","",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/10/Lyanna_Mormont_%28S06E10%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160627190658,Lyanna Mormont,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3d/Lyanna_Mormont%27s_letter.png,"Lyanna's message to Stannis, which reads: ""Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark.""",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/80/Lyanna_mormont_season_6_episode_7.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20160611003838,Lyanna personally leading men when Jon travels to Stannis' old camp.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/15/609_Lyanna_Scowl.png,Lyanna scowls at Ramsay Bolton during the parley before the battle.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/fe/Maege.png,"Closeup image of Maege Mormont, Lyanna's mother, who appeared as a non-speaking cameo among Robb's lieutenants in Season 1 of the TV series.",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f3/The_North.png,"Bear Island is located off the northwest coast of the North, making it vulnerable to attack by sea from both the ironborn and the wildlings.","","","","",House Stark

But his life took a dark turn when, at age seventeen, he fell in love with Gwyn Whitehill, the daughter of his father’s bitter rival. Bloodshed ensued and Lord Forrester faced a grim choice: go to war, or exile Asher across the Narrow Sea. He chose the latter.

Renly Baratheon,"King Renly I Baratheon is a recurring character in the first and second seasons. He is played by guest star Gethin Anthony and debuts in ""Lord Snow.""
Born to Steffon and Cassana Baratheon, Renly is the youngest of three brothers and thus fourth in line to inherit the throne after Joffrey, Tommen, and Stannis. He was granted the title of Lord Paramount of the Stormlands by his brother Robert, whose small council he also served on as Master of Laws, but abandoned the latter position when laying claim to the Iron Throne, styling himself as Renly of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm. Margaery Tyrell became Renly's queen when she married him in an alliance; however, it was her brother Loras whom he truly loved. During talks of an alliance with the Starks, his reign abruptly ended when a Shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon assassinated Renly inside his tent. This led most of his bannermen from the Stormlands and some of the Reach to submit to his older brother Stannis as their new king.","Renly is the third and youngest son of Steffon and Cassana Baratheon. Steffon was the head of House Baratheon and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. The Stormlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Baratheon is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Renly has two older brothers Robert and Stannis. Their parents died when the boys were young and Robert inherited his father's titles. Robert led a rebellion against King Aerys II Targaryen, deposing and replacing him as the King on the Iron Throne. He made Renly the Lord of Storm's End following his victory. Renly was only a child during the civil war, so he did not fight.
Renly serves Robert as Master of Laws on the King's small council in King's Landing. He is fourth in line to the throne, behind his nephews Joffrey and Tommen and his older brother Stannis. Renly is popular at court because of his friendly manner and keen fashion sense.
Renly has been involved in a homosexual romance with Ser Loras Tyrell for many years. They must keep their love a secret because the dominant religion of the realm, the Faith of the Seven, considers homosexuality to be a sin, although many people are nonetheless aware of their relationship as something of an open secret.","Renly was established to have an extremely strained relationship with his two brothers, Robert and Stannis. The long-ridiculed youngest brother, originally Renly saw no hope of ever becoming king as there were too many heirs with claims better than his for the Iron Throne. With inspiration from his lover Loras Tyrell, however, Renly arrogantly flouted the line of succession and declared himself king ahead of Stannis after Robert died. However, his strained relationship with his brothers didn't prevent him from complimenting Robert behind his back that he used to be good at killing and showing concern when he was mortally wounded by the boar. Renly also claimed to have once loved Stannis after their final encounter, making him the only brother to say as much about one of the others whereas Robert openly stated he never loved either of them. Stannis pretty much says the same about Robert but claims to grieve for Renly in a way after he murders him. However, Stannis does not show genuine remorse for the act until after he is defeated at the Battle of the Blackwater.
Unlike his other brothers, who undoubtedly would make bad kings but were skilled in battle; Robert, a fierce warrior but incompetent king, and Stannis a proven battle commander but unmerciful lord, Renly never raised a sword in combat. Adding to this, he used to become uneasy around violence and blood, throwing up when a knight was maimed after jousting and even after Loras cut him to prove a point, Renly was still squeamish and treated it as if it was a mortal wound. According to him, all he heard about from Robert was how he was never ""tough"" enough, and came to resent the idea that good soldiers automatically make good kings, which was seen when Ned Stark attempted to reinforce Stannis as the rightful heir. He disregarded the fact that a king, while having to be charismatic and peaceful, also had to be legitimately strong, which his brothers were on account of being respectively skilled warriors and commanders.
Despite his lacklustre on the battlefield, Renly was skilled in politics. He became a member of Robert's small council while he was alive and forged a marriage alliance with House Tyrell to support his claim for the Throne, gaining more bannermen and strengthening his army by marrying Margaery Tyrell. At the same time however, the prospect of a marriage alliance was to create a line of children, which he was was unable to do on account of his homosexuality until Margaery reformed that their marriage was only on paper. Renly was patient; for all of his zeal to obtain the title of king he was capable of waiting until Robb Stark had weakened the forces in King's Landing and take control later on. He also had some understanding of warfare tactics and planned to take Joffrey hostage after learning of his true parentage to weaken House Lannister so there would be no opposition for his titles.
For all of his ambitions, Renly only attempted to assist his own claim and never neutralised those against him.

Mace Tyrell,"Lord Mace Tyrell is a recurring character in the fourth, fifth and sixth seasons. He is played by guest star Roger Ashton-Griffiths and debuts in ""The Lion and the Rose"".
Lord Mace Tyrell is the Lord of Highgarden and head of House Tyrell. He is the father of Loras and Margaery Tyrell, and the son of Olenna Tyrell. He initially supported Renly Baratheon's claim to the Iron Throne in the War of the Five Kings, but after Renly's death he successfully negotiated an alliance with House Lannister to support King Joffrey's claim to the throne, on the condition that his daughter Margaery would marry Joffrey, making her the new queen and giving House Tyrell the prestige of entering into the royal bloodline. He was appointed both Master of Ships and Master of Coin on King Tommen's small council.","Mace Tyrell is the Lord of Highgarden and head of House Tyrell, one of the Great Houses of Westeros. He is the Lord Paramount of the Reach and Warden of the South. The Tyrells are one of the richest and most powerful families in Westeros, second only to the Lannisters - for while the mountains of the Westerlands possess rich gold mines, the fields of the Reach are the most fertile in Westeros, capable of supporting armies almost twice the size of any other kingdom.
Mace is not considered a great strategist or general himself - his own mother Olenna openly describes him as an oaf. On the other hand, he has shown good judgment in delegating such tasks to trusted, skilled subordinates, such as the famous general Randyll Tarly, who often commands Mace's forces in battle.
Mace might not be the most intelligent man, but he is an amiable fellow well-liked by most of his bannermen, as well a loving husband and father. Mace has one son, Loras, and a daughter, Margaery, arguably the most eligible woman in the Seven Kingdoms. Mace hopes to make a good match for her to increase the already considerable power and influence of his family. Mace is particularly eager for Margaery to secure a royal marriage for their family because unlike some of the other Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms such as the Starks or Lannisters, the Tyrells never ruled as kings in their own right, but were granted control of the Reach as a reward for submitting to Aegon the Conqueror during the Targaryen Conquest three hundred years ago. Thus entering into the royal bloodline would increase House Tyrell's prestige and secure their rule over their fractious vassals in the Reach.
During Robert's Rebellion, Mace and House Tyrell stayed loyal to House Targaryen. The Tyrells owed their rule over Highgarden and the Reach to the Targaryen kings, who after the Targaryen Conquest three centuries before had awarded rule of the Reach to the Tyrells ahead of other families from the region which actually had better claims (such as House Florent). The Tyrell armies were able to inflict the only defeat that Robert Baratheon suffered during the entire war at the Battle of Ashford. Afterwards, Mace's massive army moved east to lay siege to the mighty castle-seat of the Baratheons, Storm's End. The Siege of Storm's End lasted the better part of a year, while Mace and his commanders feasted in sight of the starving garrison led by Robert's younger brother Stannis. Ultimately Stannis's determined defense held, and the siege only succeeded in pinning down Mace's army and preventing it from assisting the Targaryens in the climactic battles occurring further north. After the Sack of King's Landing, Eddard Stark rode south with the main rebel army to relieve the siege. With the capital city in rebel hands, and both Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and his father Mad King Aerys dead, Mace saw that the war was clearly lost and gave no battle to Lord Eddard. Instead he peacefully dipped his banners and submitted to Robert's rule, and in return was treated leniently, pardoned, and allowed to continue ruling the Reach as his family had before the war. However, ever since there was never any great love between Mace Tyrell and Stannis Baratheon.","","4, 5, 6","Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach, Warden of the South, Master of Ships (to Joffrey I and, Tommen I), Master of Coin (to Tommen I), Hand of the King (formerly; claimant; to Renly I)",Deceased,Burned alive in a wildfire explosion orchestrated by Cersei Lannister,Highgarden,House Tyrell,Andal,"","Luthor Tyrell (Lord Paramount of the Reach), Stannis Baratheon (Master of Ships), Tyrion Lannister (Master of Coin)","",Luthor Tyrell,Olenna Tyrell,Alerie Tyrell,"Loras Tyrell, Margaery Tyrell","","",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e2/MaceTyrell-Profile.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20160719041706,Mace Tyrell,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/ed/Margaery_wedding_dress_Great_Sept.jpg,Mace at his daughter's wedding.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b5/Thelawsofgodsandmen3.jpg,Mace as a judge at Tyrion's trial.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b4/504_Mace_at_Small_Council_dark_green_costume.jpg,Mace Tyrell leaving King's Landing for Braavos.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b3/Oathbreaker_22.jpg,Mace at a small council meeting.,"","","","","","",House Tyrell

Bronn,"Ser Bronn is a major character in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. He initially appeared as a recurring character in the first season.

Bronn is a skilled and dangerous sellsword who comes to prominence when he champions for Tyrion Lannister in his trial by combat in the Eyrie. Bronn subsequently enters Tyrion's service as his bodyguard and enforcer.
While Bronn begins as a common and obscure mercenary, over the course of the narrative his fortunes continue to gradually rise. Bronn is briefly appointed Commander of the City Watch in King's Landing when Tyrion is acting Hand of the King in Season 2. He is then rewarded with a knighthood for the vital role he performed during the Battle of the Blackwater, taking on the formal name ""Ser Bronn of the Blackwater"". His status in Westerosi society rises even further when he is betrothed to Lollys Stokeworth, though the betrothal is annulled and he is sent to Dorne with Jaime Lannister to rescue Myrcella Baratheon from the vengeful family of Oberyn Martell. He is poisoned by Tyene Sand and almost dies, but survives and is allowed to leave Dorne. He later accompanies Jaime to Riverrun as part of a Lannister host. They take command of the Second Siege of Riverrun from the Freys, and succeed in getting Edmure Tully to surrender the castle. He and Jaime return to King's Landing in time to witness Cersei being crowned Queen.","Bronn is a sellsword; a mercenary soldier whose service as a warrior is for hire. Not much is known about his past or family. Both his parents beat him, and his nose was accidentally broken when his mother hit him with kitchenware, which she had meant for Bronn's younger brother. When Tyrion Lannister introduced him to Tywin Lannister, Bronn said that his father is no one Lord Tywin would know. During a drinking game with Tyrion and Shae, Bronn claims that he killed a woman before he was 12 years old, though it was in self-defense as she was attacking him with an axe. Bronn also confirmed Tyrion's claim that Bronn has been beyond the Wall. When asked why he was there, he bluntly answers that it was ""work"".","Bronn is sarcastic, with a black sense of humor, and a pragmatic, amoral philosophy for life. However, he is not completely heartless, nor is he sadistic. He openly expresses sympathy to Tyrion after making the pragmatic decision not to champion him during his second trial. After Tyrion asks him if he would murder an innocent baby in front of her mother without question, Bronn denies it and claims that he would ask for a price, implying that he would demand a very high price for such a despicable deed. Despite Bronn's avaricious nature, which is sneered at by more honorable knights, he is a skilled and dangerous fighter. His combat style centers around speed and agility, dodging enemy attacks instead of blocking them. For this reason, he does not wear heavy armor or capes or use shields, but instead relies on just his sword and knives. He is also a skilled archer and is apparently literate. His pragmatic approach to combat is the main reason why he refused to fight the Mountain in Tyrion's second trial by combat despite his superior stamina and speed, explaining ""One misstep, and I'm dead"".","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","Ser, Commander of the City Watch, (formerly)",Alive,"","",House Lannister,"","","","","","","","","","",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/be/Bronn_the_broken_man_s6.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160629013344,Bronn,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/51/Bronn.jpg,Bronn battles against the hill tribes.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/cd/Tyrion_and_Bronn_1x09.png,Bronn plays a drinking game with Tyrion.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/de/Tyrion_and_Bronn.jpg,"Tyrion and Bronn before battle in ""Blackwater"".",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/77/Bronn_singing.jpg,Bronn sings the Rains of Castamere.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/6c/Bronn_2x09.png,"Bronn, about to blow up half of Stannis's fleet.",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/80/We_need_Details.jpg,Tyrion is fascinated at Pod's ability to pleasure women.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e0/Podrick_with_tyrion_and_bronn_waiting_for_doran_martell.png,Bronn with Tyrion and Podrick waiting for Doran Martell.,House Lannister

She briefly ousted him from King's Landing, but events quickly spiraled out of her control, and half a year later she fled to Dragonstone, where she and her son, who was also named Aegon, were captured by Aegon's supporters. Aegon then had her fed to his dragon, Sunfyre, while forcing his nephew to watch.
However, Aegon had been severely injured during a dragon-battle during the war and his mind was increasingly gone to milk of the poppy. His unpopularity became so strong that his own men poisoned him just a few months after her execution. After Aegon's death, his daughter was wed to Rhaenyra's son (who became Aegon III) to unite the two warring factions of House Targaryen.","","","King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm",Deceased,Poisoned by his own men,"Red Keep, King's Landing","House Targaryen, Greens","","",Viserys I Targaryen,Aegon III Targaryen,Viserys I Targaryen,Alicent Hightower,Helaena Targaryen,"Jaehaerys Targaryen, Jaehaera Targaryen, Maelor Targaryen","Rhaenyra Targaryen (paternal half-sister), Helaena Targaryen, Aemond Targaryen,","",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/ea/Aegon_II.png/revision/latest?cb=20160313092941,Aegon II Targaryen,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/76/Aegon_II_Coronation.png,"",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5e/Ambush_at_Dragonstone.png,"Aegon feeds his sister to his dragon, Sunfyre.","","","","","","","","","","",House Targaryen

Eddard Stark,"Lord Eddard Stark, also known as Ned Stark, is a major character in the first season. He is played by starring cast member Sean Bean, and debuts in the series premiere. He reappears in flashbacks during the sixth season, played by Sebastian Croft and Robert Aramayo.
Eddard was the head of House Stark, the Lord of Winterfell, Lord Paramount and Warden of the North, and later Hand of the King to King Robert I Baratheon. He is the older brother of Benjen, Lyanna and the younger brother of Brandon Stark. He is father of Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon by his wife, Catelyn Tully, and uncle of Jon Snow, who he raised as his bastard son. He is a dedicated husband and father, a loyal friend and an honorable lord.
Eddard's execution and revealing the illegitimacy of Cersei's children was the spark of the War of the Five Kings between Joffrey Baratheon, Robb, Renly Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon and Balon Greyjoy - being posthumously responsible for the involvement of four of the kings in this war.","Eddard Stark was the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms, and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rules the region from their seat of Winterfell, and Eddard also held the title Lord of Winterfell. In addition, he was the Warden of the North.
Eddard was married to Lady Catelyn of House Tully. Though they barely knew one another when they wed, they formed a strong and loving marriage. They have five legitimate children: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Eddard also had an ""illegitimate bastard son"", Jon Snow, reportedly by a common serving girl named Wylla. Jon's presence at Winterfell was a source of friction between Eddard and his wife. Nevertheless, Eddard was close to all his children and was well-loved and respected by all of them. He seemed to have a soft spot for his youngest daughter, Arya.
Eddard was the second son of Lord Rickard Stark. Lord Rickard served King Aerys II Targaryen as Warden of the North. Eddard's older brother Brandon was Rickard's heir. Eddard also has a younger sister Lyanna and a younger brother Benjen. Eddard was a stoic, dutiful, and honorable man and was considered to embody the values of the North.
Eddard was a trusted, close friend and counselor of King Robert Baratheon. He supported Robert's play for the throne by acting as a general in several major battles. Eddard's sister Lyanna, who was betrothed to Robert, was purportedly kidnapped by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, igniting a war. Brandon protested the kidnapping, but his attempt to bring Rhaegar to justice failed. Lord Rickard was summoned to court in King's Landing by Aerys, and both Brandon and Rickard were brutally executed by the Mad King.
Their deaths left Eddard to inherit Rickard's responsibilities, serving King Robert instead. Brandon had been betrothed to Catelyn, and Eddard also inherited his brother's bride. Lyanna died in Eddard's arms during the conflict. Despite his happy family life, Eddard still felt the losses of his family quite keenly, often visiting his sister's tomb to light a candle for her as his daughter, Sansa, remembered.
Eddard's other younger sibling, Benjen, still lives and is a member of the Night's Watch, an institution of which Eddard is a keen supporter. He also appeared to have troubles keeping his bannermen in line as Stannis Baratheon remembered his brother, Robert, saying the Northmen were difficult to control, even with Eddard on his side.
Eddard wielded a Valyrian greatsword named Ice (an heirloom of House Stark) which he used on ceremonial occasions.","Eddard Stark was a man of principle, being patient, cautious, intelligent, noble and possessing an immense sense of duty. He was remembered profusely for being extremely honorable and a firmly moral character at heart. He always reacted to situations calmly and reasonably, even if the situations endangered him or the people he loved. He was a skilled and fierce warrior but certainly preferred the diplomatic and peaceful solution to situations, even if that solution was martial law. He, himself, remarked that he didn't fear death, and recollected that he grew up with soldiers - Cersei elaborated that Eddard's older brother Brandon was born to lead, whilst he  was born to follow. In his own words, Ned explained that he ""learned how to die a long time ago."" Ned viewed situations and individuals by the scope of their moral compass, and judged almost everything on that perspective. He also speculated the concept that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword, showing that he can be pragmatic in his sense of honor. In spite of that, he was not narrow-minded and did not appear prejudiced, arrogant or self-serving.
Ned was a very loving father to all of his children, including Jon Snow, his ""bastard son"", even though Catelyn was of a different opinion. He was very patient with the romantic delusions that Sansa enjoyed, visibly tolerating the fact that she was obsessed with being married to a handsome prince. He did point out to her that Joffrey lacked bravery, strength of character, and even morality, but she didn't listen. He was also on great terms with Arya, and seemed to be one of few who could tolerate her feisty, adventurous mentality, and even encouraged it. He was, in many ways, like his son Robb, in that his sense of honor and duty ruled every aspect of his being, and he was a charismatic leader to those who served him. Ned had a close relationship with Jon Snow, who Ned raised as his own child alongside his lawful children. Like Robb, Jon inherited Ned’s traits of honor and duty. Ned treated Jon as his son - regardless of his legitimacy, and despite Jon being his nephew, and not his son. Ned was willing to sacrifice his own honor to protect Jon, and spent years letting everyone - including his whole family - believe that Jon was his bastard son to ensure Jon's protection. Ned's death provoked such a brutal reaction from all of his family because they all loved him more than words could say.
Eddard was highly skilled in combat, both in strategy and in a duel. He killed Ser Gerold Hightower, survived the Battle of the Trident and held his own impressively against the younger Jaime Lannister. He had earned the respect of men like Ser Arthur Dayne, the greatest warrior of his generation - indeed, Ned's sense of honor seemed to impress everyone around him, including the rigid and cold Stannis Baratheon and the cunning Varys. Aside from being selfless, dutiful and brave, he was slow to anger and thus he was one of the very, very few who could withstand the temper and misgivings of Robert Baratheon, with whom he shared a relationship that was a hair's breadth from being considered a brotherly one. Robert actually admitted that he never loved Stannis or Renly Baratheon, and had instead labelled Ned as his brother, showing that Robert's admiration for his old comrade was tremendous. Ned's calm and reasonable mentality was respected firmly by Robert, who recognized that Ned was the only one who would dare say no to him for the right reasons. Robert obviously trusted Ned, begging him on his deathbed to help Jofffrey in a way that Robert himself had failed and even naming the man as Protector of the Realm until Joffrey came of age. However, he had the fatal weakness of being a poor politician, preferring to take the honorable route than doing what would politically benefit him - Cersei speculated that, in the game of thrones, one had to take what was in arm's reach or be damned, but Ned disagreed because the fight he fought was never to survive, but to preserve the lives of those he loved.
Eddard Stark's honorable and dutiful personality put him at a weakness of judging people impractically by the evidence he saw with his own eyes, as opposed to the bigger picture. He had a bad habit of trusting people, which was a mistake he disastrously made with Petyr Baelish. He also did not predict that Cersei Lannister would be unreasonable enough to turn down his offer of mercy if and when Robert found out that Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella weren't his children; a mistake that cost Ned not just his own life, but set off a chain of events that has also so far led to the deaths of his wife and two of his sons. Still, Cersei's refusal also ironically led to the deaths of all three of her own children, an outcome that Ned sought to prevent in the first place when he confronted Cersei despite the trauma that her son Joffrey had visited upon his daughters on the kingsroad. Finally, he judged Jaime Lannister to have betrayed his king for dishonorable reasons the moment he discovered the Kingslayer sitting on the Iron Throne with the Mad King's corpse lying at his feet, though Jaime's arrogance did nothing to dispel this misconception. Ned would have probably understood if Jaime explained how Aerys ordered him to kill his father Tywin, since Ned would never have followed that kind of order even if such a refusal would have cost him his life.","1, 4, 6, 7","Lord of Winterfell, Lord Paramount of the North, Warden of the North, Hand of the King (to Robert I), Lord Regent (for Joffrey I), Protector of the Realm (for Joffrey I)",Deceased,Beheaded by Ser Ilyn Payne at the order of Joffrey Baratheon,Winterfell,House Stark,Northmen,Old Gods of the Forest,"Rickard Stark (Lord Paramount of the North), Jon Arryn (Hand of the King)","Roose Bolton (Lord Paramount of the North), Robb Stark (Lord of Winterfell), Tyrion Lannister (Hand of the King)",Rickard Stark,"",Catelyn Tully,"Robb Stark, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Bran Stark, Rickon StarkJon Snow (nephew raised as bastard son)","Brandon Stark, Lyanna Stark, Benjen Stark","",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/37/Eddard_Stark_infobox_new.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160730050722,Eddard Stark,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c9/Young_Ned_and_Benjen_Stark_train_at_Winterfell..JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/140?cb=20160730053907,"Ned and Benjen as children, training at Winterfell.",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/94/Ned_Catelyn_wedding.png,Ned's wedding to Catelyn Tully.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5c/Eddard_1x01.jpg,Eddard passes sentence on Will.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0c/Winter_is_Coming_Robert_crypt_with_ned.jpg,Ned in the catacombs visiting Lyanna's crypt with Robert.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/63/Eddard_and_Jon.jpg,Eddard and his nephew Jon Snow.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d9/Ned_and_Arya.jpg,Eddard and Arya at the Crossroads Inn.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/66/Eddard_and_Cersei_1x07.png,Ned confronts Cersei.,House Stark
Roose Bolton,"Lord Roose Bolton is a major character in the fifth and sixth seasons. He initially appeared as a recurring character in the second, third and fourth seasons. He was played by starring cast member Michael McElhatton and debuted in ""Garden of Bones."" Roose Bolton was the Lord of the Dreadfort and the head of House Bolton, the former ruling Great House of the North after usurping the position from House Stark. He was the father of Ramsay Bolton, his legitimized bastard, and an unnamed newborn baby from his wife, Walda Frey.
During the War of the Five Kings, Roose initially fights for his liege lord, Robb Stark, but later betrays and murders Robb at the Red Wedding after allying with House Frey and House Lannister when the war turns against them. Roose is appointed the new Warden of the North as a reward, and to strengthen his hold on the North, he has his son Ramsay marry Sansa Stark, while he marries Walder Frey's granddaughter, Walda, and impregnates her. After Sansa escapes with Theon Greyjoy, Roose contemplates disinheriting Ramsay for his carelessness in favor of his legitimate baby son, but he is betrayed and murdered by his own son, who goes on to kill Walda and the baby as well.","Roose Bolton was the head of House Bolton, a vassal family to House Stark of Winterfell. He was the Lord of the Dreadfort. Roose takes pride in his house sigil; the flayed man.
Although torture is outlawed in the North, his family is famous for flaying the skin from their enemies as a means of torture and execution. Roose fought for Lord Eddard Stark in the civil war against House Targaryen known as Robert's Rebellion and proved his worth as a soldier in the Battle of the Trident. He advised Robert Baratheon to execute Ser Barristan Selmy, a legendary Kingsguard sworn to the Targaryens, but Robert overruled Roose and pardoned Selmy.
Roose Bolton had a trueborn son, Domeric, by his first wife, who perished, forcing Roose to rely on his bastard son, Ramsay Snow.","Roose Bolton is cautious, intelligent, ruthless, and easily capable of unspeakable cruelty. He has a very calm and calculating personality, never publicly expressing anger, happiness, or sadness. Politically astute, he frequently offered the most pragmatic advice to Robb Stark, albeit the most ruthless, such as recommending that they put prisoners to the sword because they were having difficulty feeding them all. However, despite his ruthlessness, Roose appears to follow a code of honor to a certain degree since he frequently opposes the needless, cruel deeds performed by Ramsay and his men, and outright shoots down Ramsay's suggestion to murder Jon Snow, since Jon is both a bastard and the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He appears genuinely shocked and saddened upon seeing the massacred Northmen at Gregor Clegane's hands at Harrenhal, hinting that he abhors needless violence and cruelty.
When he realized that Robb Stark had no chance of winning the war, he sought an alliance with House Frey and House Lannister. Roose's cold realism clashed with Robb's idealism. When all seemed lost, he did not attempt to fight for a losing cause and instead decided to safeguard his family's future by turning on his king. Similar to Tywin, Roose valued the legacy of House Bolton as something bigger than himself.
Roose was a cunning strategist, both on and off the battlefield. His betrayal was sudden and unexpected, and it resulted in the utter decimation of the rebellious Northern lords and their armies while his own forces remained basically intact. This would allow House Bolton to overpower the now defenseless home territories of these other Houses in the North, ensuring Bolton rule.
Unlike Robb Stark, he believed that he wasn't a lord to indulge his own petty whims and that strengthening his House was his first priority: in that context, he married Walda Frey to guarantee his alliance with House Frey. As a result, Roose was somewhat critical of Ramsay's more wild or shocking actions, because as Roose's only heir, Ramsay represents the future of House Bolton. Roose did enjoy sadistically toying with other people - as seen when he briefly taunted Jaime Lannister that King's Landing might have fallen to Stannis Baratheon - but a major difference between him and Ramsay is that Roose had caution enough to only partake in such amusements when he thinks he can get away with it. Roose was also cautious enough to realize that, despite his success in elevating House Bolton as a Great House of Westeros, this position is fragile and that only proper alliances would allow him to retain his power. This was the main reason behind his decision to marry Sansa Stark to Ramsay and his willingness to consider an alliance with Petyr Baelish and the Lords of the Vale after Tywin Lannister's death.
Despite his cruelty, he did have some form of affection for his children, and seemed pleased and possibly happy when his new son's birth was announced by Maester Wolkan. He also seemed to care for Ramsay to an extent, but overall mistrusted him.
For all his caution while dealing with his enemies, Roose ironically fails to see the threats to his claim (or even his life) right in front of him. Despite knowing of Ramsay's impulsiveness and insanity, Roose frequently mistreats Ramsay by reminding him of his bastard status and implying that he will disinherit him despite his legitimization by publicly announcing that he is expecting a trueborn child, right in Ramsay's face, all of which ultimately lead to Roose's death by his own son's hands. This also somewhat echoes Tywin's fate, as he was also killed by his own son, though Roose's case is more extreme, as he knew what kind of person Ramsay was but made no attempt to protect himself. However, Ramsay's unwillingness to follow Roose's cautious and practical advice ultimately led to his own downfall not long afterward, as well as House Bolton's extinction. In a twisted sense of irony, Roose's actions to elevate House Bolton's status and legacy instead led to its annihilation.","2, 3, 4, 5, 6","Lord of the Dreadfort, Lord of Winterfell, Lord Paramount of the North, Warden of the North",Deceased,"Fatally stabbed in the chest by his own son, Ramsay Bolton",The Dreadfort,"House Bolton, House Stark",Northmen,Old Gods of the Forest,"Eddard Stark (Warden of the North), Robb Stark (Lord of Winterfell)",Ramsay Bolton,"","","Unknown wife, Walda Frey (second wife)","trueborn:, Domeric Bolton (son by first wife), Unnamed son (son by Walda), baseborn:, Ramsay Bolton (originally Snow)","","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c8/Roose-S6-Profile.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160801075614,Roose Bolton,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/fb/Roose-Bolton-bannerman.jpg,Roose Bolton: A seemingly loyal Stark bannerman.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/9a/Roosethemessanger.jpg,Lord Bolton delivers news of Winterfell's capture.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/44/Robb_Stark_and_Roose_Bolton.jpg,Robb Stark and Roose Bolton discuss plans to recapture Winterfell.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a3/Roose-and-Robb-3x01.jpg,Robb Stark and Roose Bolton discuss their attack on Harrenhal.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/56/Red_wedding_roose_robb.jpg,"""The Lannisters send their regards"" - Roose murders Robb in.""",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e0/Roose-Ramsay-Reek.jpg,Roose scolds Ramsay over his treatment of Theon.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1f/Roose_and_Ramsay_confer.jpg,Ramsay reports his success at Moat Cailin to his father.,House Bolton

Her pregnant mother and brother Viserys, fled to the island of Dragonstone, the ancestral home of House Targaryen, to escape Robert. Daenerys's brother Rhaegar Targaryen was killed in the war by Robert. The forces of House Lannister murdered Rhaegar's wife, Elia Martell, and their children, Rhaenys and Aegon, during the Sack of King's Landing.
But unbeknownst to Daenerys and the rest of her family, her oldest brother Rhaegar had another son by Lyanna Stark, who died shortly after giving birth to him. In her final moments, she revealed the true name of their son to her brother Eddard, who passed the boy off as his bastard son, Jon Snow, and raised him in Winterfell. Jon initially joined the Night's Watch but later became the King in the North.
On the night Daenerys was born on Dragonstone, a vast storm raged. For this reason, she is sometimes called ""Daenerys Stormborn"". Her mother died soon after she was born, leaving her an orphan. As a baby, she was taken into exile in the Free Cities with her brother, Viserys, by loyal retainers, among them Ser Willem Darry.
After years spent fruitlessly trying to raise support to retake the Iron Throne, Viserys and Daenerys were given sanctuary by Magister Illyrio Mopatis in the Free City of Pentos. She dreams of finding a peaceful home and a place to belong. She lives in constant fear of Viserys, who hits her when his temper is risen (in his words, whenever she ""wakes the dragon""). Living under Viserys's domination has left her meek and malleable.","Daenerys is polite and well-spoken, but filled with quiet determination. She used to be cowed by her brother's ambitions and his occasional cruel rages, but her time amongst the Dothraki has taught her pride, confidence and skills of command. She is still somewhat naive of the world due to being young and living her life as an exile (with only her petulant brother to rely on for knowledge), but she is intelligent and quick to understand now that she is free to pursue her own path.
Daenerys spent her entire life living on the sufferance of others, bouncing back and forth between one benefactor or the next (like Illyrio Mopatis) with her brother, until whatever dreams they had of supporting the exiles' claim wore off and they'd have to move on to another patron. As a result, Daenerys has never known a true home. Constantly living under her brother's domination has given Daenerys a great empathy with the downtrodden of the world. She is deeply sympathetic to those she perceives as oppressed, while at the same time, her pent-up frustration from years of being mentally and physically dominated by her petty would-be-king of a brother make Daenerys capable of being utterly ruthless against those she perceives as oppressing others. This has produced a large amount of black-white thinking in Daenerys's mind, and she can be idealistic to a fault. For example, on seeing the plight of the slaves in Slaver's Bay, Daenerys becomes determined that she must free all of the slaves in the region - with little thought devoted to the practical after-effects which will result from this. A particular example is when the Great Masters of Meereen crucified 163 children as she approached the city, in an attempt to intimidate her. After she took the city, instead of pardoning the slave-masters, she had 163 of them crucified in retribution, including many who opposed the crucifixion of the children, unconcerned about any negative political fallout which would result.
Unlike many in her House, Daenerys has thus far not exhibited the ""Targaryen madness"" that plagued her father (and to a lesser extent, Viserys). She can be ruthless to her perceived enemies, but while Viserys was cruel and demanding to his servants and even his benefactors, Daenerys reciprocates the loyalty of those who follow her with gratitude and compassion, especially her inner circle of friends and her dragons. On the other hand, insanity was often a late-onset condition in the Targaryens, and it remains to be seen how Daenerys's mentality develops as she matures.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men (claimant), Lady Regnant of the Seven, Kingdoms (claimant), Protector of the Realm (claimant), Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons, Queen of Meereen (formerly)",Alive,"","Dragonstone (birthplace), Free Cities (raised)",House Targaryen,Valyrian,"","","",Aerys II Targaryen,Rhaella Targaryen,Drogo,Rhaego (stillborn),"Rhaegar Targaryen, Viserys Targaryen",Daario Naharis (formerly),http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/88/Daenerys-0.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170106122450,Daenerys Targaryen,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/11/Daenerys_birth.jpg,Daenerys's birth,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d4/Daenerys_and_Viserys.jpg,Daenerys and her brother Viserys in Pentos.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/91/Unsullied.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20110531122211,Daenerys and Viserys with Illyrio.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/17/Daenerys_1x03.png,Daenerys leads her Khalasar across the Dothraki sea.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/da/Drogo_Dany_Season_1.jpg,Dany falls in love with Drogo,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/de/Dany-heart.png,Daenerys eats the heart of a stallion.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1c/Daenerys_and_dragon.jpg,Daenerys with one of her newly-hatched dragons.,House Targaryen

Petyr Baelish,"Lord Petyr Baelish, popularly called Littlefinger, is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. He is played by starring cast member Aidan Gillen and debuts in ""Lord Snow"". Petyr Baelish was the Master of Coin on the Small Council. He is a skilled manipulator and uses his ownership of brothels in King's Landing to both accrue intelligence on political rivals and acquire vast wealth. Baelish's spy network is eclipsed only by that of Varys.
After marrying Lady Lysa Tully, widow of Lord Jon Arryn of the Vale, and her subsequent death at his hand, he becomes the Lord Protector of the Vale. Because of his relationship with Robin's mother, Baelish is able to heavily influence the young Lord Robin Arryn, the new Lord Paramount of the Vale.","Petyr Baelish is the head of House Baelish and the lord of an extremely minor holding, so small it has neither name nor a maester, located in a small area within the Fingers, a coastal region in the northeastern shores of the Vale of Arryn. He is currently the only living member of House Baelish.
House Baelish had very meager origins and no distinguished lineage: Petyr's great-grandfather was a lowly sellsword from Braavos who came to the Vale at the invitation of House Corbray. Petyr's grandfather was a poor hedge knight, who managed to earn a minor lordship of a few stony acres in the smallest peninsula of the Fingers.
Petyr's father fought in the War of the Ninepenny Kings, the preemptive assault on the forces of Maelys Blackfyre, the last of the Blackfyre Pretenders, before they could attempt an invasion of Westeros. During the conflict, Petyr's father served well under Lord Hoster Tully. Through their good relationship Hoster agreed to foster his son Petyr at Riverrun, a great honor for a lesser House.
Petyr went to Riverrun when he was eight years old, carrying all he owned in a bundle. At Riverrun he befriended Hoster's daughters Catelyn and Lysa Tully. Their brother Edmure mockingly nicknamed him ""Littlefinger"", in reference to his small height at the time and the location of his minor landholdings. The nickname would stick with him throughout his life. Eventually, even Petyr sarcastically embraced the nickname, because it showed how far he had risen, from an impoverished noble-born boy from an insignificant minor House in the ""little Finger"" peninsula of the Vale, to one of the most powerful officials at the royal court.
Petyr became smitten with Catelyn, but she never returned his affections. Lysa was infatuated with Petyr, but he only loved Catelyn. Eventually when she was betrothed to Brandon Stark, heir to Lord of Winterfell and Lord Paramount of the North, Petyr challenged him to a duel, thinking he could win through pluck and courage but he was promptly overpowered and nearly killed, though Catelyn begged Brandon to spare his life. Embittered, Petyr was cast out of Riverrun and returned to the Vale. During the course of Robert's Rebellion, however, Brandon was killed by the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen, so Catelyn married his younger brother Eddard Stark, while to secure a political alliance Lysa was wed to Jon Arryn, ruler of the Vale. Manipulating Lysa's infatuation with himself, Petyr ingratiated himself into Jon's services, first as customs officer at Gulltown, where he increased the port's revenues tenfold. Seeing Littlefinger's financial acumen, Jon was easily convinced by Lysa to later bring Littlefinger to the royal court at King's Landing, and make him Master of Coin on King Robert Baratheon's Small Council. Petyr's naked ambition often placed him at odds with the Master of Whisperers, Varys.
In charge of the crown's treasury, Littlefinger rapidly grew into a powerful player in royal politics and a master of court intrigues. Of an older mindset, few who did not know him suspected Littlefinger as a threat, seeing only that he was a man from a very minor House, with no distinguished lineage, significant landholdings, or armies. Instead, Littlefinger based his newfound power on money. Baelish is unscrupulous in his search for power and wealth: he has bought multiple brothels in the city. Particularly a high class brothel catering to the nobles in the city, cynically noting that whores make a better investment than ships, because they rarely sink. Baelish makes good use of his brothels to have his agents spy on and manipulate his clientele, and owns one of the largest spy networks in Westeros, second only to Varys's. Littlefinger has been known to privately bribe lords who have unusual or violent sexual fetishes, if they pay the right price; ranging from supplying lords with amputee prostitutes, to delivering young boys to pederasts, and even delivering prostitutes to be secretly murdered by his clients for thrill-kills.
Due to their past friendship as children, Catelyn Stark continued to believe that Lord Baelish was a friend she could count on at court.","Baelish is a cunning, Machiavellian, unpredictable, and ruthless manipulator of court politics. He is at times capable of putting on a seemingly friendly face with a friendly smile - but his eyes don't smile when his mouth does. The exact inner motivations that drive Baelish are unclear, as are his ultimate goals, but he has no real loyalty or genuine affection for anyone. Behind his smiles and forced mild manners, Littlefinger is shrewd and calculating, willing to casually dispose of people who trusted him, like a man replacing a coat he no longer needs. He is an extremely intelligent man, not only a genius at financial matters but at cynically controlling those around him. As Varys observed, he is a grasper from a minor House, with a very great skill at befriending and ultimately maneuvering powerful people.
Littlefinger started out as an impoverished noble from an insignificant minor House in the ""little Finger"" peninsula of the Vale, but felt constantly looked down upon for his relatively lowly status by much higher noblemen. His treatment by the Tullys when he was a young man, and his near-death at the hands of Brandon Stark, embittered him against both the Tullys and the Starks. He was also never strongly attached to the other Vale lords who looked down on him most of his life. Petyr loved Catelyn, but she saw him only like a brother, and her father wanted him to have nothing to do with her.
In truth, underneath Littlefinger's people-mask, he is a cold sociopath who hungers for power over others basically for its own sake. Curiously, even seemingly plausible goals such as ""revenge against the Starks and Tullys"" - which at times is what he tells himself he is doing - are really only excuses and rationalizations for his utter ambition to control everything around him - he has stated more than once that he wants ""everything."" Even Littlefinger's alleged feelings for Catelyn Stark truly seem to have just been a rationalization for his greed for power. Though surely, Littlefinger himself is convinced that he truly ""loved"" her, in reality his attraction was one-sided, and he was obsessively stalking a girl who never returned his affections beyond a platonic level. Hypocritically, Littlefinger became angered that the Tullys rejected him, probably for his low social status - when Catelyn's younger sister Lysa Tully was utterly obsessed with him. Petyr, ironically, wanted nothing to do with Lysa, and used her only as a means to an end to get to Catelyn. Later after Catelyn died, Littlefinger transferred his obsession to Sansa. Even though, as he himself noted, Sansa is young enough to be his own daughter, she reminds him so much of the young Catelyn at her age that he forgets himself, even allowing himself to try to kiss her - showing that he didn't really love Catelyn as a person so much as a concept, given that he feels she is interchangeable with her daughter.
In brief moments when Littlefinger has opened up to Sansa Stark, it is disturbingly revealed that despite his keen skill at assessing the emotions and goals of others and using it to manipulate them, he has a highly warped, skewed view of the world. In Littlefinger's mind, he narrates himself as the hero of his own storybook, as it were: as he says, the weak boy from a minor family who hoped that in a better world, ""love could overcome strength and duty"". He genuinely feels (or seems to feel) that he is the victim in all of this, despite the fact that he was the one who orchestrated the entire War of the Five Kings - a war in which tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians have died. Littlefinger nonetheless believes he is the victim of the uncaring forces of a stratified aristocracy that prevented him from marrying Catelyn - when in reality, Catelyn herself was simply never romantically interested in him, regardless of his social status.
Petyr's surprising lack of insight when it comes to his romantic obsessions were revealed when he encountered Catelyn again in Renly Baratheon's army camp after her husband's execution - a betrayal which Catelyn by now would surely have known he was at least partially complicit in. Instead, Petyr started babbling nonsensically to Catelyn that ""fate"" had granted them the opportunity to finally be together now that Eddard was dead - even though he previously saw that they were deeply in love, and any sane man would realize that she would be both deeply in mourning for her husband, and have reason to be suspicious that he had something to do with his death. Littlefinger's stalker-crush extended to the point that even after years of bitterly hating the Tullys and Starks, and even hating Catelyn at times for rejecting him, at other times he would persist to indulge in fantasies that one day she would come running into his arms.
Some men such as Varys engage in court intrigue and engage in murder because they feel they are doing what they must to ensure safety and order for the realm as a whole, while other men such as Tywin Lannister engage in court intrigue because they want to secure more power for themselves and for their family legacy. Baelish, meanwhile, does these things just because he can: he enjoys exerting power over other people. Sometimes this can take the form of out-witting or out-manipulating major court players such as Varys or Cersei - even Tyrion Lannister enjoyed the challenge of ""the game"". Yet Littlefinger also enjoys crushing the powerless when he thinks he can get away with it, people who pose no threat to him. Baelish's acquisition of multiple brothels sums up a major aspect of his personality: he is willing to use other people, often vulnerable and weak people (i.e., prostitutes), purely for his own gain (cynically selling his whores' sexual services for gold), while at the same time using the weaknesses of his enemies as leverage (i.e., blackmailing them about their visits to his brothels). Sometimes Baelish doesn't even use people for any actual purpose, but simply because he enjoys destroying them like a man swatting a fly.
Despite his ingenious planning and manipulation, Baelish is not incapable of making mistakes, nor is he above overplaying his hand if he is convinced of the superiority of his position, political or otherwise, which is a direct contrast to Littlefinger's usual meek and cautious nature, proving himself not above arrogance. The first mistake was when he subtly made a jab at Cersei about her unnatural relationship with her brother Jaime, that knowledge is power, which resulted in Cersei nearly having him killed before deciding to remind him of his place. Another fatal flaw Baelish has is underestimating people. He remarked to Varys that Tyrion is an unworthy ally; he underestimated Ramsay Bolton's vile nature; and he wrongly believed that the North would not rally behind a ""motherless bastard"" like Jon Snow.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","Lord of Harrenhal (nominally), Lord Protector of the Vale, Master of Coin (formerly; to Robert I and Joffrey I)",Alive,"","Baelish Castle, the Fingers, the Vale of Arryn",House Baelish,"Andal, partially Braavosi","",Janos Slynt (Lord of Harrenhal),Tyrion Lannister (Master of Coin),Baelish,"",Lysa Arryn,"","","",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b7/Petyr_Battle_of_Bastards_infobox_image.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160807090043,Petyr Baelish,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/9a/Hoster_Baelish.jpg,Petyr's father (left) befriends Lord Hoster Tully during the War of the Ninepenny Kings.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/bb/Petyr_vs_Brandon.png,Petyr's failed attempt to win Catelyn's hand.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f8/Eddard_and_Petyr_1x03.png,Eddard assaulting Petyr for saying his wife is in this brothel.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5c/Petyr_and_Varys_1x05.png,Baelish and Varys converse in the Red Keep.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/ee/Eddard_and_Petyr_1x07.png,Lord Baelish turns on Eddard Stark.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a4/SilentSistersNedsBones.jpg,Petyr Baelish gives Ned's bones to Catelyn.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e8/Loras_vengeance_Renly.jpg,"Petyr Baelish forging a new alliance with the Tyrells in ""The Ghost of Harrenhal"".",""

Loras is the heir to Highgarden and the Tyrell lands and titles, and this status, along with his skills and good looks, makes him possibly the most sought-after bachelor in all of Westeros.
Loras is a skilled knight famed for his many tournament victories and his good looks, which make him popular with the smallfolk and with young women in particular. Loras is one of the few knights who has on rare occasion managed to defeat the formidable Jaime Lannister in a joust. He is commonly known as the ""Knight of the Flowers"", as a rose is the sigil of House Tyrell and he thus wears armor elaborately engraved with flowers.
Loras is the former squire of Lord Renly Baratheon and remains Renly's lover. When the series begins Loras is in King's Landing primarily to compete in tourneys and attend court.","Before the start of the War of the Five Kings, and later his arrest and imprisonment by the Faith Militant, Loras led a carefree life as a tourney knight. A prodigiously skilled warrior and an extremely popular young man, he is shown to be gracious towards everyone around him and grateful whenever someone does him a favor. He was quick to thank Sandor Clegane when the latter saved Loras's life from his ferocious brother, Gregor, and showed his appreciation by declaring him champion without having a joust. However, Loras was also rather spoiled to a fault, which could have arguably played a role in his downfall. Renly pointed this out to Loras by the expensive and extravagant suit of armor that his father procured for him to wear at tournaments. Loras also shows a hint of his grandmother's influence when mocked Robb Stark for ""hiding behind his mother's skirts"" as opposed to appearing in person to treat with Renly and Jaime Lannister for his incest when the latter tried to intimidate Loras into calling of his engagement to Cersei Lannister.
Loras thought that Renly Baratheon would have been a wonderful king because he didn't enjoy killing like Robert did, and he was extremely popular unlike Stannis. When Renly was murdered, Loras correctly deduced it was Stannis and furiously vowed that he would personally execute the man, briefly ignoring the fact that the odds were against him being able to do so. One other unfortunate weakness in Loras was his lack of discretion. He eagerly engaged with Olyvar upon meeting him, despite Margaery's warnings that people could find out about it, and gave little thought to the possibility that their relationship might be used against him. Still, due to the protection afforded him all his life as the heir to Highgarden, Loras reacted with arrogant aggression when Lancel Lannister and the Faith Militant arrested him. He was also rather quick to leave along with his grandmother and sister after lying to the High Sparrow about his relationship with Renly at his inquest. Only when the Sparrows call Olyvar forward to testify does Loras begin to show genuine fear that all his lies, including the one he just told the High Sparrow, were finally catching up with him, and they do when Olyvar betrays Loras by giving irrefutable evidence of their relationship to the High Sparrow. His imprisonment by the Faith Militant demoralized Loras to the point that he was willing to publicly renounce all he once held dear and humble himself before the High Sparrow in order to be released.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6","Ser (formerly), Lord Commander of the Kingsguard (formerly; claimant)",Deceased,Burned alive in a wildfire explosion orchestrated by Cersei Lannister,Highgarden,Sparrows,Andal,Faith of the Seven,"","",Mace Tyrell,Alerie Tyrell,"","",Margaery Tyrell,"Renly Baratheon, Olyvar",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a7/LorasHD3x06-0.png/revision/latest?cb=20150519170126,Loras Tyrell,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/67/Lorasknight.png,"Loras at the Tourney of the Hand in ""The Wolf and the Lion.""",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d7/BrienneJoinsRenlysKingsguard.jpg,Loras watches as Brienne asks to join Renly's Kingsguard,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e7/LorasMargaery.jpg,Loras walks with Margaery in Renly's Camp,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e8/Loras_vengeance_Renly.jpg,Loras vows vengeance over the body of his dead lover.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a6/Loras_ghost_of_harrenhal.jpg,Loras reacts to Renly's death,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/53/Loras_as_Renly.jpg,"Loras in Renly's armor fighting in ""Blackwater.""",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/2c/Loras_sansal_The_Climb.jpg,Loras and Sansa Stark spend time together,""
Drogo,"Khal Drogo is a major character in the first season. He is played by starring cast member Jason Momoa, and debuts in the series premiere. He also appears in a cameo in the second season, as part of a vision in ""Valar Morghulis"". Drogo is a khal, or chieftain, of the Dothraki people and is often referred to with his full title, Khal Drogo.","Drogo is a khal or warlord of the Dothraki, the famed nomadic horse-lords of the eastern continent beyond the Narrow Sea. The Dothraki are fierce warriors, skilled in battle, unrelenting in combat and known for savagery towards non-Dothraki. Amongst their own people they have a code of honor, albeit still a harsh and unforgiving one. Drogo was very young to have his own khalasar, particularly such a large one. He is a legendary warrior and has never been defeated in battle. Drogo desired the most beautiful and exotic woman in the world as his khaleesi or wife, and enlisted Magister Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos to help him find such a woman.
He is guarded by bloodriders including Qotho. Generals or ko in his khalasar include Pono and Jhaqo, men who guard him, follow him in battle and, when Drogo dies, it is their duty and honor to follow him even then to continue serving him.","In battle, Drogo is known for his savagery, brutality, and lack of relent or remorse to his opponents. The fearsome khal had never been defeated in combat and because of this his braid reached down below his waist. Indeed, Drogo was ruthless in battle and highly skilled, able to kill an armed man in seconds flat with just his bare hands. Initially, he had no problems with rape, slavery or murder, but every action he makes is because of his devotion to the Dothraki and reclaiming what is theirs. He was utterly fearless to the point of recklessness - when Mago holds an arakh to his chest, he does not react, only moving closer to his opponent, deepening the wound, to show his courage and disdain for his opponent, before openly disarming himself and outmatching the mutinous Dothraki effectively unarmed, though the wound eventually caused his excruciating death.
Despite his extremely violent, at times cruel nature within battle, Drogo reveals a completely different compassionate and gentle side which only surfaces around his wife, Daenerys Targaryen. Though he seemed initially unmoved with his betrothal to Daenerys and the rough consummation on the eve of their wedding, he grew to respect her due to her spirit, determination, and role as khaleesi. As Daenerys learned more of Dothraki culture and language, and Drogo learned more about her, theirs grew into a marriage of equals, and they settled happily some two months in. His caring side was visible when he rushed to see if Daenerys was unharmed after an unsuccessful assassination attempt, rather than immediately executing the wine seller who attempted to poison her and her unborn child.
His soft side for Daenerys can also clash with his own savage nature, as noted when he ripped the tongue out of Mago's throat for calling Daenerys a ""foreign whore"" (although he could have also killed him just for challenging Drogo in the first place), and again when he killed Viserys Targaryen only after the drunken prince threatened to cut Daenerys open and remove her child. He went against years of Dothraki belief and superstition by vowing to take the Iron Throne for his wife and unborn son by travelling across the Narrow Sea, even though the Dothraki have feared salt water for years.","1, 2",Khal,Deceased,Smothered by Daenerys Targaryen in a mercy killing after being left in a vegetative state by Mirri Maz Duur,Vaes Dothrak,Himself,Dothraki,Great Stallion,"","",Bharbo,"",Daenerys Targaryen,Rhaego (stillborn),"","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1f/Drogo_1x01b.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110626031733,Drogo,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a9/Drogo-arrives.png,Drogo inspects his bride.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/df/Drogo_Dany_Wedding_Day.png,The wedding of Drogo and Daenerys Targaryen,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c8/Daenerys_%26_Drogo_1x03.png,Daenerys tells Drogo that she expects a son.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/6f/Drogoswears.png,Drogo swears to cross the Narrow Sea and take the Iron Throne.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/46/Drogo_1x08.jpg,Drogo kills Mago for his defiance.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/78/Daenerys_and_Drogo_1x10.png,Daenerys and a vegetative Drogo,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/43/Daenerys_and_Drogo_2x10.png,Daenerys and Drogo in an illusion.,""

Balon Greyjoy,"King Balon Greyjoy is a recurring character in the second, third and sixth seasons. He is played by guest star Patrick Malahide and debuted in ""The Night Lands."" Balon Greyjoy is the Lord Reaper of Pyke and the head of House Greyjoy. He is the father of Yara and Theon Greyjoy, and the older brother of Euron, and Aeron ""Damphair"" Greyjoy.","Balon Greyjoy was the head of House Greyjoy and Lord of the Iron Islands. The Iron Islands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Greyjoy is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Greyjoy rule the region from their seat at Pyke and Balon also holds the title Lord Reaper of Pyke. He was a hard, ambitious and ruthless man.
Balon was married to Alannys of House Harlaw. They had four children Rodrik, Maron, Yara and Theon. Yara is their only daughter.  Eight years before the start of the series Balon declared himself King of the Iron Islands and rose in the rebellion against the Iron Throne to revive the ""Old Way"", which had once led the ironborn to rule much of the western coast of Westeros. However, he was shown to only listen to the stories of the Old Way and did not live by them. He was, however, defeated in a bloody war. His elder two sons were killed and his third son, Theon, was taken by Lord Eddard Stark as a hostage for Balon's good behavior and obedience. Yara has remained on the Iron Islands and has become a warrior and captain in her own right, which is unusual for women on the isles.","Balon Greyjoy was shown to be a stubborn, unyielding man who often had difficulty seeing past his own desires. Despite his spectacular defeat in his failed uprising, he still leapt at the first opportunity to invade Westeros again, all out of sheer ambition to revive the Old Way. This stubbornness greatly affected Balon’s relationship with his son, and to some degree his daughter; he treated Theon rather coldly when the latter returned to Pyke, and when Theon pointed out that it was his father’s failed rebellion that caused his son to be taken as a hostage in the first place, Balon refused to admit any personal fault. His hatred for the Starks was so great that he planned to attack the North while Robb was away, despite Theon's warning that if they did so, they would eventually be thrown out, either by Robb winning and retaking the North, or the Lannisters winning and throwing the Greyjoys out. After Deepwood Mott was retaken by the Glovers, and Yara pointed out that future invasion attempts would produce no lasting results, Balon essentially said that he didn't care about results, only that the ironborn followed his orders. This pushed Yara to angrily remind her father that his unflagging adherence to the Old Way had led to the deaths of his two elder sons (and again to Theon becoming a hostage of the Starks), which Balon did not appreciate.
However, deep down, Balon was shown to love his family to a certain degree; he showed true affection for Yara and allowed her to become a warrior and ship’s captain in her own right, something highly unusual for a man so defined by tradition. He also seemed genuinely embittered by the loss of Rodrik and Maron, as well as by Theon being taken away from him, and outwardly admits that Theon becoming like the Starks was something he feared.
Through dialogue, however, it is clear that Balon did not have an amicable relationship with his brother, Euron Greyjoy. His first reaction to Euron's return was to brandish a knife and attempt to kill him, which would constitute kinslaying, though their dialogue implies that Euron has gone insane and Balon's actions were in self-defense.","2, 3, 6","King of the Iron Islands, King of Salt and Rock[1], Son of the Sea Wind, Lord Reaper of Pyke, Lord of the Iron Islands (formerly)",Deceased,Thrown from a bridge by his brother Euron Greyjoy,Pyke,House Greyjoy,Ironborn,Drowned God,"",Euron Greyjoy,"","",Alannys Greyjoy,"Rodrik Greyjoy, Maron Greyjoy, Yara Greyjoy, Theon Greyjoy","Euron Greyjoy, Aeron Greyjoy","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/27/Balon_Season_6.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160211221219,Balon Greyjoy,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/97/Balon_kneels.png,Balon kneels to Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark after his failed rebellion.,"","","","","","","","","","","","",House Greyjoy

Ser Arthur Dayne was a knight of House Dayne who bore the title of ""Sword of the Morning"" as he possessed the ancestral sword of House Dayne, Dawn. He was also a member of the Kingsguard under King Aerys II Targaryen.","Ser Arthur was the second son of Beric Dayne, Lord of Starfall. As the wielder of the sword Dawn, which had been forged from the metal of a fallen star, he bore the title of ""the Sword of the Morning"". He was sent to deal with the Kingswood Brotherhood and subsequently killed the Smiling Knight in a duel.","Ser Arthur Dayne was a legendary knight and one of the finest men to have joined the Kingsguard, probably rivalled only by Ser Barristan Selmy. He was extremely courageous, leading the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood and outmatching the Smiling Knight in sword combat - the Smiling Knight had previously defeated a young Jaime Lannister and was considered a terrifying opponent, making Arthur's defeat of him impressive. He is remembered as an excellent swordsman, and when he finally appears when Bran Stark wargs to the confrontation at the Tower of Joy, he is shown to be an incredibly skilled warrior, wielding two swords expertly and cleaving through nearly every opponent he faced - the Three-Eyed Raven pointed out that Arthur was vastly superior to Eddard Stark, and the only reason that he lost was because he was blindsided by Howland Reed.
Ser Arthur's reputation was such that, when people remembered him, it was in acclaim. Years later, Eddard Stark would comment that Ser Arthur Dayne was the best warrior Ned had ever encountered. Even when they outnumbered him, Ned and his companions were extremely wary about how to approach him, showing that Arthur's skill and reputation frightened them. In addition, Arthur was extremely loyal, to a fault, to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, stating very matter-of-factly that the only reason he hadn't fought on the Trident was because Rhaegar had ordered otherwise. Even after the deaths of Rhaegar and Aerys, he continued to follow Rhaegar's orders to protect the pregnant Lyanna Stark, even if that meant killing her brother Eddard. Not much else is known about Ser Arthur, but he is shown to be extremely gentlemanly and polite in Bran's vision, greeting his father by title and even wishing him ""good fortune in the wars to come""; a hint that despite his skills as a swordsman, even he sometimes, if not always, considered the possibility of losing before fighting someone else to the death. This also suggests that Arthur did not fear death as evidenced by the fact that he didn't beg for his life when Howland Reed wounded him, simply facing down Eddard Stark for seconds before Ned finished him off.",6,"Ser, Sword of the Morning",Deceased,Stabbed in the neck and back by Howland Reed and partially decapitated by Eddard Stark,Starfall,"Kingsguard, House Dayne","""Stony"" Dornishmen","","","",Beric Dayne,"","","",Ashara Dayne,"",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0a/603_Arthur_Dayne_Side.png/revision/latest?cb=20160719184728,Arthur Dayne,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/78/BookOfBrothersDayne.jpg,Ser Arthur's and Ser Gerold's entries in The Book of Brothers.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/96/Ser_Arthur_Dayne_%28right%29_at_the_Tower_of_Joy.png,Ser Arthur Dayne with Lord Commander Gerold Hightower at the Tower of Joy.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e9/Screen_Shot_2016-05-09_at_5.10.59_PM.png,Ser Arthur is stabbed by Howland Reed before Ned Stark finishes him off with Dawn.,"","","","","","","","",""

Brienne of Tarth,"Brienne Tarth, commonly known as Brienne of Tarth, is a major character in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. She initially appeared as a recurring character in the second season. She is played by starring cast member Gwendoline Christie and debuts in ""What is Dead May Never Die."" She is a warrior of House Tarth, vassals to House Baratheon, and the only daughter of Selwyn Tarth.","Brienne is the sole surviving child and heir of Lord Selwyn Tarth of Evenfall Hall, on the island of Tarth, located in the Narrow Sea off the coast of the Stormlands. She is unusually tall and muscular for a woman by Westerosi standards and developed a taste for martial activity as a child. Brienne has grown up to become skilled at arms and dreams of becoming a knight.
Brienne's mother died when she was so young that she doesn't remember her. She had some siblings but they all died in childhood. As the sole heir of House Tarth, she posed a fairly promising marriage prospect for men from other noble Houses, but due to her physicality and personality has never seriously pursued a marriage alliance with another House.
She is also called The Maid of Tarth, or, disparagingly, Brienne the Beauty, due to her appearance.","Brienne has spent most of her life as the object of scorn, rejection and – at best – pity. When she tried to dress and act like a proper lady, she was met with mockery and disdain for her unattractive appearance and lack of feminine social graces; when she turned to a career more suited to her talents as a warrior, she received only contempt and resentment for her gender despite her considerable skill. Her lifetime of scorn and condescension led her to becoming extremely pragmatic and blunt. However, it has also provided her with nerves of Valyrian steel, and she is completely unafraid to face off against warriors as powerful or as intimidating as Jaime Lannister (arguably the best sword in the realm), Loras Tyrell (a renowned warrior) and even Sandor Clegane (a physically brutal and extremely intimidating person with an infamous temper).
Perhaps because of this background, Brienne is as awkward in personality as she is in appearance; Catelyn Stark notices that she has none of the easy confidence of some other warrior women. She yearns for respect and acceptance from others, and easily gives her love and loyalty to the few people who treat her with any degree of genuine courtesy. Renly Baratheon, Catelyn Stark, and Jaime Lannister are among those who have won Brienne's friendship and service in this manner. Brienne, much like Ned Stark, is motivated by her own sense of honour and duty, thus seeing most dishonourable acts as unacceptable. She often faces situations where her honour is eclipsed and opposed by her heart, since she confessed to Jaime that her failure to sway the Blackfish would result in the two of them fighting one another again, saying so in a tone that states outright she doesn't want to fight him - even though she has a considerable chance of defeating him.
She can be headstrong, sarcastic, cynical and judgmental, but she is also honest, straightforward, loyal, and determined. Although she has received extremely poor treatment from most knights, Brienne clings to a naïvely idealized concept of knighthood. Despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that she has no expectation of ever being recognized by society for her accomplishments and strength of character, she nevertheless strives to live up to the ideal of a true knight at all times. Brienne adheres to the expectations and guidelines of knighthood almost formally, since she expressed at the climax of her fight with the Hound that she had no wish to kill him (which he ignored and continued to fight her), and also carried out the killing of Stannis Baratheon as if it were an official execution, even permitting him any last words.
Brienne has proven herself to be one of the strongest fighters in Westeros, albeit the most underrated. In combat, she relies on a combination of her intimidating size, strength, and unrelenting brute force to win most fights. This unrelenting style is what allowed her to defeat Loras Tyrell and Sandor Clegane, two of the greatest swordsmen in the realm. She could fight three men at the same time, beat two armoured soldiers in a confined space and hold her ground against Jaime Lannister. Even after she was presented with a prominent disadvantage, such as being disarmed, she would resort brutally to continue fighting, shown when she proceeded to fight the Hound even after he'd ridden her of her sword. Jaime confessed that he considered her a good fighter, even before they became friends.
Brienne of Tarth is extremely noble and humble at all times, as evidenced by her confessing at several points that she was not a knight, and at one point not even a lady - even though she was inevitably a lady of Tarth as the only daughter of Lord Selwyn Tarth. This was probably motivated by her self-induced belief that she was inferior to the standards of a true knight, given that she has faced being underrated and underappreciated for her appearance and gender her whole life. The irony of the entire situation is that she exemplifies the qualities of a true knight: She is a strong and skilled fighter, is merciful and compassionate, unshakably loyal and determined, and takes her duties as a warrior sworn to a higher authority extremely seriously. The only reason she isn't viewed as such by the people of the Seven Kingdoms is because she is a woman.","2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","",Alive,"",Evenfall Hall,House Tarth,Andal,Faith of the Seven,"","",Selwyn Tarth,"","","","","",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/35/No_One_29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160614170946,Brienne of Tarth,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d7/BrienneJoinsRenlysKingsguard.jpg,Brienne asks to join Renly's Kingsguard.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/67/BrienneAndCatelynMeet.jpg,Brienne escorts Lady Catelyn Stark.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/6a/Brienne_kneels.jpg,Brienne swears fealty to Lady Catelyn.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/ef/Catelyn_and_Jaime.jpg,Catelyn and Brienne talk to Jaime Lannister.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4f/Jaime_and_Brienne.jpg,Brienne escorting Jaime to King's Landing.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/9a/Brienne_Owns_Jaime.jpg,Brienne beats down Jaime.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/fc/Brienne_Rape_Beatdown.jpg,Brienne is nearly raped.,""

Olenna Tyrell,"Lady Olenna Tyrell, née Redwyne, is a recurring character in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. She is played by Dame Diana Rigg.
The elderly matriarch of House Tyrell, Lady Olenna has been a master of court politics and intrigue par excellence throughout her life. She's also known for her wit and sarcasm. As a result, Lady Olenna is popularly nicknamed the Queen of Thorns, in reference to the Tyrell sigil - a rose - and her cutting barbs. In many ways she is the de facto head of House Tyrell at the time of the War of the Five Kings and appears to hold a great deal of influence over the Reach.
After most of her family are killed in the Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, an event orchestrated by Cersei Lannister, Olenna's desire for vengeance leads her to pledge House Tyrell's forces to Daenerys Targaryen.","Olenna Tyrell is the widow of Lord Luthor Tyrell and the mother of Mace Tyrell, the former Lord of Highgarden, Warden of the South, Lord Paramount of the Reach, and head of House Tyrell. She is the grandmother of his children Loras and Margaery. She was born into House Redwyne, one of the most prominent and powerful vassals of House Tyrell.
In her youth, Olenna Redwyne was engaged to a member of House Targaryen, as it was ""all the rage"" at the time; it was her sister Viola to whom Luthor Tyrell was expected to marry. The night before Luthor was to propose to Viola, Olenna snuck into his chamber and seduced him, leaving him ""unable to walk downstairs"" the next day to propose to Viola. Olenna did this because the thought of marrying a Targaryen and his ""ludicrous silver hair"" did not appeal to her.
Although Olenna consistently referred to Luthor as an oaf, she was genuinely fond of him, and confided to Margaery that she had some difficulty accepting his death after his body was delivered to her.","Olenna's most prominent traits are her sharp wit, high cunning and intelligence. A politically astute woman, Olenna has been a master of court politics and intrigue her entire life. She appears to have a very dark sense of humor and likes to mock those around her, including her own family. Despite this, Olenna clearly loves her family dearly, especially her grand-children. Furthermore, she reveals to her grand-daughter that even though she considered her husband Lord Luthor Tyrell an oaf, she genuinely loved him and struggled to accept his death. Olenna clearly is a staunch supporter of House Tyrell, despite being born and raised a Redwyne. In this regard, she is very similar to Tywin Lannister, who also places the power and prestige of his House above all else. Olenna, however, is wise to not be as ruthless or as cold as he was. She strikes a much healthier balance between loyalty to her House and affection for her family than Tywin ever did: whereas all three of his children grew to bitterly resent him, Olenna's grandchildren dote on her, and even her exasperation for Mace's oafishness is affectionate.
Olenna's strength and competence in politics has made her the de facto head of House Tyrell and, by extension, the Reach itself. An outspoken woman with little patience for inconvenience, she is unafraid of using her power as head of House Tyrell to threaten her enemies. Olenna never shies from stating her opinion (unless it is more advantageous to mask it) and truly hates Cersei Lannister for her cruelty, incompetence, and deep selfishness. She also admits that she finds Sansa Stark rather dull and is interested in her political potential and not her personality. Olenna stated that she did not trust Tywin Lannister, nor did she especially like him as a person, but she did respect him for his steadfast diligence, ambition and intellect - she almost praised him for the fact that he actually lived up to his reputation. Olenna is incredibly intelligent, as well as wise enough to understand that sometimes people must work with their enemies rather than constantly compete against them, which also explains why she respected Lord Tywin. On the darker side, Olenna has no problem harming children - such as when she poisons Joffrey, leading to his death in his mother's arms - proving she can be just as ruthless as Tywin or Littlefinger when necessary, although not entirely without reason, as she did it in order to protect Margaery from the monster that Joffrey truly was.
Following the death of her family, Olenna's tongue grew even sharper. Instead of showcasing her cunning wit, her jagged barbs now stem from anger and pain. Olenna has not grown reckless or despondent, however: she is ready and willing to seek revenge, and remains strategic and pragmatic about doing so. She also makes it clear that since her entire future has been robbed from her, she doesn't care about survival; she is perfectly willing to die, and exhaust whatever forces she has, if it means she can bring Cersei to justice.","3, 4, 5, 6, 7","",Alive,"",The Arbor,"House Tyrell, House Targaryen",Andal,"","","","","",Luthor Tyrell,Mace Tyrell,Viola Redwyne,"",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/bb/Olenna_season_6_a.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160718204242,Olenna Tyrell,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f1/LemonCakes4.jpg,Olenna and her grandaughter Margaery lunch with Sansa Stark.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4e/Season_3_Ep_4_Varys_Olenna.png,Varys and Olenna discuss Sansa.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/ad/Olenna_Podrick_Kissed_by_Fire.png,Olenna meets with Tyrion Lannister.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0b/Olennafeast.png,Olenna during Tyrion and Sansa's wedding feast.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1c/Margolenna.png,Olenna prepares Margaery for her wedding to Joffrey.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0a/Olenna_and_Sansa_2.jpg,Olenna consoles Sansa.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/56/Olennamarg2.png,Olenna hints at her involvement in Joffrey's murder.,House Tyrell

""Hodor"" is a seemingly nonsense word, though in the process it became the name everyone calls him. It is derived from the phrase ""hold the door"", the words that Hodor heard during the seizure that mentally disabled him as a result of the future Bran Stark accidentally warging into his young self during a vision. Nonetheless, House Stark set him to work at a productive occupation within his capacities, as a stableboy serving at Winterfell. Hodor is incredibly large and strong. While he is slow of wits, he is gentle and loyal to the Starks. He is actually Old Nan's great-grandson and only known relative.","Hodor generally seems to have a happy demeanor, overjoyed by basic things like presenting Bran with a new saddle, hearing the echo of his own voice in a well, or greeting one of the Stark direwolves. He is deeply loyal to the Starks, who have treated him very well, apart from the time Bran Stark warged into him as a child to save himself causing Hodor to become simple-minded. Despite his large size and strength, Hodor is a gentle soul who is terrified by violence - even violence done by himself, as he often cowers in fear instead of fighting back against foes who are actually smaller than he is. Even so, his loyalty to the Starks is so great that he continues to follow (or rather, carry) Bran Stark through great dangers.
In his youth, before his fateful seizure Hodor is shown with an ordinary friendly personality, capable of speech, getting on well with Lyanna, Ned and Benjen Stark and demonstrating an interest in learning swordplay.","1, 2, 3, 4, 6","",Deceased,"Torn apart by wights, giving time for Bran Stark to escape",Winterfell,House Stark,Northmen,"","","","","","","","","",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/18/Season_6_hodor_main.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160617020835,Hodor,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/39/Young_hodor.jpg,Hodor as a young stable boy called Wylis.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/9a/Tyrion_and_Bran_1x04.png,"Hodor carries Bran to see Tyrion in ""Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things.""",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b6/Summer_2x03.jpg,"Bran wakes to see Summer and Hodor in ""What is Dead May Never Die"".",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/18/Bran_and_Rickon_Alive.jpg,"Hodor, Bran, and Rickon in the crypts of Winterfell in ""The Prince of Winterfell.""",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/8e/Bran%2C_Hodor%2C_Summer_and_Shaggydog.jpg,"Hodor and Bran emerging from the Crypts with Shaggydog and Summer in ""Valar Morghulis.""",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/91/Young_hodor_seizing_hold_the_door.jpg,"""Hold the door!""","","",House Stark

Kevan is the younger brother of Lord Tywin Lannister and one of his most loyal and trusted officers in the Lannister armies during the War of the Five Kings.
After his brother's death at the hands of his nephew Tyrion, Kevan opposes his niece Cersei's seizure of power as leader of her son King Tommen's Small Council. Refusing his appointment by Cersei as Master of War, he departs the court in protest and returns to Casterly Rock.
When Cersei is arrested on various charges by the Faith Militant, Kevan returns to King's Landing and is appointed Hand of the King by Grand Maester Pycelle.","Kevan was the second son of the late Lord Tytos Lannister. He was the brother of Lord Tywin Lannister the head of House Lannister and Lord of Casterly Rock. Kevan was married to Dorna Lannister - who King Robert characterized as ""a dumb whore with a fat arse"" - and they had a son Lancel, who was a squire to King Robert Baratheon. He was a noted knight who served his elder brother loyally as an adviser, and was respected for his wise and candid counsel.","Kevan was reliable, solid and serious, but not as prideful, decisive or ruthless as his older brother Tywin, which is demonstrated by his suggestion to sue for peace during the fallout of Ned Stark's murder (until Tyrion had to correct him with the fact that Joffrey destroyed any hope of such an arrangement). Like Tywin, he was willing to work with rivals even if he didn't trust them, as demonstrated by his offering Olenna Tyrell a place in the Small Council. He was always content with being a follower rather than a leader but could take charge when the situation demanded it, chastising Cersei for not teaching Tommen how to rule and trying to act above her position as Queen Mother, culminating in him becoming Hand of the King at Pycelle's request. Also, Kevan was somewhat perceptive in a way, deducing how Cersei was opting to line the Small Council with sycophants like Qyburn and fools like Mace Tyrell - he was visibly distasteful of such an act.
Alas, he did not know Cersei as well as Tywin, and did not, like everyone else, foresee his fate in the Great Sept of Baelor.

Elia Martell,"Princess Elia Martell is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. She is deceased when the events of the series begin and is not expected to appear. Elia was the sister to Doran Martell, the Prince of Dorne and head of House Martell, and Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper. She was married to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, heir to Aerys II, and bore him two children: Rhaenys and Aegon. She and her children were killed by Ser Gregor Clegane on the orders of Lord Tywin Lannister during the Sack of King's Landing at the end of Robert's Rebellion.","Princess Elia was the wife of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. They had two children; a daughter Rhaenys, and a son, Aegon. She was born into House Martell in Dorne. She was the younger sister of Prince Doran Martell, ruler of Dorne at the time, and an older sister of Prince Oberyn. Her marriage to Prince Rhaegar was arranged by King Aerys II Targaryen and considered an insult by Tywin Lannister, Aerys's Hand of the King, who had proposed his daughter Cersei as a bride for the Prince but was rejected. The marriage was one of the reasons Lord Tywin resigned his post as Hand. Like her younger brother, Elia was very popular among the Dornish people.
As a teenager, Elia accompanied her brother Oberyn on a visit to Casterly Rock. While there, Elia and Oberyn were eager to see the monster that had just been born. Cersei finally showed them the baby, but the Martell siblings were somewhat disappointed to see that Tyrion was just a baby, and somewhat disturbed by Cersei's already strong hatred of him.
Elia loved her husband Prince Rhaegar dearly. She bore him two children, Rhaenys and Aegon, to whom she was equally devoted; according to Oberyn, Elia took care of them from birth, rather than delegating the task to a wet nurse. Both pregnancies were very difficult, and each nearly killed Elia.
When Robert's Rebellion erupted, Elia was kept in King's Landing by King Aerys to ensure the loyalty of House Martell during the conflict- a measure the Martells considered unnecessary, as they would always fight for whichever side Elia was on and had no intention of breaking their oaths of loyalty to the Targaryens. Ultimately Rhaegar was killed in personal combat with Robert Baratheon at the Battle of the Trident, leaving Elia widowed. A few weeks later during the Sack of King's Landing, Tywin Lannister's army betrayed the Targaryens and overran the city. Ser Gregor Clegane - known as ""The Mountain That Rides"" burst into the royal chambers and before Elia's eyes, killed her daughter Rhaenys, then bashed her infant son's head in against a wall.

Yara Greyjoy,"Queen Yara Greyjoy is a recurring character in the second, third, fourth, sixth and seventh seasons. She is played by guest star Gemma Whelan and debuts in ""The Night Lands"". Yara is an ironborn, Theon Greyjoy's older sister and his only surviving sibling. She was raised at Pyke, the stronghold of House Greyjoy. Yara is a fierce warrior and commands her own longship. She is currently a claimant to the throne of the Kingdom of the Iron Islands and an ally of Daenerys Targaryen.
Yara is captain of her own longship, the Black Wind.","Yara is the only daughter of Lord Balon and his wife, Lady Alannys of House Harlaw. Balon is the head of House Greyjoy and the Lord of the Iron Islands. The Iron Islands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Greyjoy is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Greyjoy rules the region from their seat at Pyke and Balon also holds the title Lord Reaper of Pyke.
Yara was born and raised at Pyke. She was Balon and Alannys' third child after Rodrik and Maron. She also has a younger brother, Theon. Eight years before the start of the series, Balon rose in rebellion against the Iron Throne and was defeated in a bloody war. Balon's two older sons were killed and Theon was taken by Lord Eddard Stark as a hostage for Balon's good behavior and obedience. With Yara as Balon's only remaining child in the Iron Islands, he raised her as a surrogate son, encouraging her to become a reaver in her own right, which is unusual for women in the patriarchal culture of the ironborn. She is a fierce warrior and commands her own longship, to the disquiet of some of the ironborn who hold that women should not fight or command men in battle.","Yara Greyjoy is an ironborn woman of the finest caliber: courageous, clever, determined and proud. In sharp contrast to the allusions people have about her on the basis that she is a woman, Yara is extremely headstrong and formidable towards anybody who dares cross her, as well as possessing a sharp, cynical and sarcastic sense of humor. She rebuffed Theon's labeling her as a woman by pointing out that he was the one in skirts, knowing full well that he had already been berated for it and saying that would only enrage him. She is a fierce warrior and a staunch leader, and obdurate about her own independence. She did not apologize to her father for leading a personal mission to rescue Theon from the Boltons.
Because of her sharpness, Yara can come across as aggressive towards people she doesn't like or people who try to put her in her place, and wasn't swayed when Theon warned her against crossing him. She could be slightly judgemental and labelled Theon as idiotic for forgetting that, while he had conquered Winterfell, the ironborn were sailors and islanders and couldn't hold Winterfell for very long. Nevertheless, she clearly loved Theon enough to want to rescue him from Ramsay Bolton. By the time Theon returned to the Iron Islands after Eddard Stark's death, Yara was a renowned leader and had commanded and killed men with her own hands: Balon remarked that she knew who she was.","2, 3, 4, 6, 7",Queen of the Iron Islands (claimant),Alive,"",Pyke,"House Greyjoy, House Targaryen",Ironborn,Drowned God,Balon Greyjoy,"",Balon Greyjoy,Alannys Greyjoy,"","","Rodrik Greyjoy, Maron Greyjoy, Theon Greyjoy","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a8/Game_of_thrones_6x5_yara_promo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160808022737,Yara Greyjoy,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/39/Yara.png,Yara and Theon riding at Pyke.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/fa/Yara_arrives.jpg,Yara arrives at Winterfell.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/45/Yara_Season_3_Trailer.jpg,Yara Greyjoy assembles her strike force to rescue Theon.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/40/Yara_in_the_dreadfort.jpg,Yara enters the Dreadfort.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/ec/Yara-ep-2.jpg,Yara confronts Balon about House Greyjoy's future.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/dc/Yara_and_Aeron.png,Yara and Aeron discuss the upcoming Kingsmoot at the funeral of Balon Greyjoy.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/16/Theon_and_yara_promo_6x5.jpg,Yara and Theon during the Kingsmoot.,House Greyjoy

Aerys II Targaryen,"King Aerys II Targaryen, popularly called ""the Mad King"", is a character in Game of Thrones. Though deceased by the events of the first season, he appears in flashback form in the sixth season. He is portrayed by David Rintoul and appears in ""Blood of My Blood."" Aerys was the last member of House Targaryen to rule from the Iron Throne. He was formally styled as Aerys of the House Targaryen, the Second of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Although his rule began benevolently, he succumbed to madness and was eventually deposed by Lord Robert Baratheon in a civil war. Aerys was infamously murdered by a member of his own Kingsguard, Ser Jaime Lannister, during Lord Tywin Lannister's Sack of King's Landing. This act earned Ser Jaime the nickname ""Kingslayer"" for slaying the king that he was sworn to protect as a member of the Kingsguard.
Aerys's two surviving children, Viserys and Daenerys, were smuggled across the Narrow Sea to the Free Cities of Essos, while his last living grandson, Jon Snow, was raised as his maternal uncle Eddard Stark's bastard son to protect him from Robert's wrath. Viserys and Daenerys are intent on one day returning to Westeros to reclaim what they regard as their birthright.","Aerys fought for his father, Aegon V Targaryen, in the War of the Ninepenny Kings. He took on the tradition of Targaryen inbreeding in order to keep bloodlines pure. After his father and brother died at the tragedy of Summerhall, he became Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name. He later became spiteful of the power of others, especially that of his Hand of the King, Tywin Lannister (who had once been one of his closest friends). He later became paranoid of his own family members and his Small Council. Popularly remembered as ""the Mad King"", his reign became increasingly erratic and murderous.
Despite the fact that nobody expected Aerys to turn up, he suddenly arrived at The Great Tourney at Harrenhal. During this tourney, Aerys knighted Ser Jaime Lannister and admitted him to the Kingsguard, but not for his valor and honor. Instead, he wanted to spite his Hand of the King, Tywin Lannister. His eldest son, Rhaegar Targaryen, competed in the tourney, and after winning, he shunned his own wife, Elia Martell, and laid his winning roses in the lap of Lyanna Stark of Winterfell.
A final round of blood-letting began when Rhaegar, allegedly kidnapped Lyanna, prompting many houses in the realm to rebel. Brandon Stark protested the abduction of his sister and demanded justice. Aerys had him arrested for treason and then offered to ransom him to his father. However, when Rickard Stark rode to King's Landing as he was bid to ransom Brandon, Aerys had him arrested too, and then brutally executed both father and son.
In response, the noble houses of Stark, Tully, Arryn, and Baratheon raised the flags of rebellion and destroyed the royalist armies in several major engagements, culminating in the Battle of the Trident where Prince Rhaegar died at the hands of Lyanna's betrothed Robert Baratheon, the leader of the rebels.
King Aerys was betrayed by his former friend and King's Hand, Lord Tywin Lannister, who led an army under the false pretense of defending the capital at King's Landing. When Aerys opened the gates, Tywin proceeded to brutally sack the city. Meanwhile, Jaime, stabbed Aerys in the back and then cut his throat.
Aerys's death brought an end to the Targaryen dynasty, which had ruled the Seven Kingdoms for three centuries. He was replaced on the Iron Throne by Robert Baratheon. However, the Targaryen bloodline survived through his grandson, Jon Snow, who was passed off as a bastard of Winterfell by his maternal uncle Eddard Stark, and his two youngest children, Viserys and Daenerys, who were spirited away to the Free Cities.","Of all the Kings to sit on the Iron Throne, none induced a level of tyranny, madness and especially cruelty as Aerys Targaryen did during his rule. Dubbed the Mad King, Aerys seemingly began as a benevolent ruler until he was overwhelmed by the so-called ""Targaryen madness"" brought on by an incestuous bloodline. As a result, he began displaying traits of intense psychopathy, insanity and sadistic intentions, exacerbated by hallucinations, schizophrenia and paranoia regarding his own claim to the Throne, to the point where he burnt anyone he believed was against him, until half of the people whom he ruled were already against him.
Like many Targaryens, such as his son Viserys, Aerys was obsessed with the self-conception that he was a dragon in human skin. In regards to this, he killed his victims in a similar manner that which a dragon would; burning them alive. Jaime Lannister once observed that he loved watching them char until their skin blackened, indicating he may have suffered from pyromanica and this combined with sadism and hopeless delusions, spurred his already oppressive reign into complete tyranny. In a final bid where it appeared Robert Baratheon would take King's Landing, Aerys planted wildfire throughout the city, even the Red Keep where Aerys himself was staying. Not for one second, however, did he believe that it would result in his death, like his uncle Prince Aerion Targaryen, who killed himself by drinking wildfire. Instead, he thought he would be reborn as a dragon through a baptism by fire and burn his enemies in retribution.
Aerys's perceived lack of sanity and rational thinking seemingly caused his own death. Instead of listening to Varys or Jaime who warned him that Tywin Lannister possessed an ulterior motive when promising to defend his city for him, he only listened to the extremely sycophantic Grand Maester Pycelle who told him only what he wanted to hear. When he saw that Tywin tricked him, he foolishly ordered Jaime to execute his own father, confident that he would do so as no Kingsguard had ever disobeyed him before. Just before his death, however, Aerys showed shock and fear for the first time under his rule as Jaime approached him after killing his pyromancer. He even attempted to flee, proving that even he feared what all other tyrants cannot control nor escape: death.",6,"King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm",Deceased,"281 AL, Stabbed in the back by Ser Jaime Lannister during the Sack of King's Landing",King's Landing,House Targaryen,Valyrian,Faith of the Seven,Aegon V Targaryen,Robert I Baratheon,Aegon V Targaryen,"",Rhaella Targaryen,"Rhaegar Targaryen, Viserys Targaryen, Daenerys Targaryen","Duncan Targaryen, Rhaella Targaryen, Daeron Targaryen","",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/47/Aerys_II_Targaryen_Mad_King.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160712173113,Aerys II Targaryen,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5c/Aerys_Rickard_Brandon.png,Aerys watches Rickard and Brandon Stark die.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/89/Jamie_Stabs_Aerys.jpg,Aerys is slain by his Kingsguard Jaime Lannister.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/52/Ilyn_Payne_losing_his_tongue.jpg,King Aerys orders Ser Ilyn Payne's tongue to be cut out.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/55/Mad_King.png,"Aerys Targaryen, Second of His name, is now commonly known as ""the Mad King"".",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d8/610_Sept_of_Baelor_Destruction_Promo.png,"Aerys' legacy leads to the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, orchestrated by Cersei Lannister and Qyburn.",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b8/Liam_Burke.jpg,Liam Burke,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a3/Brandon%27s_execution.jpg,Aerys watches as Brandon Stark is executed.,House Targaryen

Ramsay Bolton,"Lord Ramsay Bolton, formerly known as Ramsay Snow, is a major character in the fourth, fifth and sixth seasons. He initially appeared as a recurring character in the third season. He is played by starring cast member Iwan Rheon, and debuts in ""Dark Wings, Dark Words"". Although he is first referred to in the second season, his name is not actually mentioned until the Season 3 finale, ""Mhysa"". Ramsay is the legitimized bastard son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort, and the unidentified wife of a miller.
In the War of the Five Kings, Ramsay is initially an ally of King Robb Stark. He is sent by his father to retake Winterfell from Theon Greyjoy, though he massacres the ironborn and torches Winterfell as part of his father's scheme to betray the Starks. He takes Theon prisoner and tortures him, eventually breaking him into his new pet, Reek. Following the Red Wedding, Ramsay joins his father in pledging for the Lannisters and is tasked with retaking Moat Cailin from the remaining ironborn, a mission that he accomplishes and which leads to his legitimization as Ramsay Bolton. To further cement their rule over the North, Ramsay is betrothed to Sansa Stark, but his abusive behavior towards her compels her to escape with Theon while Ramsay is dealing with an attack by Stannis Baratheon. In response to the possibility of being disinherited in favor of his father's trueborn son, Ramsay murders his own family and cements his position as the new Warden of the North by allying with House Karstark and House Umber. His rule comes to an end when Jon Snow retakes Winterfell with an army of Free Folk and Stark loyalists, and defeats Ramsay in personal combat. In the aftermath, Ramsay is executed for his crimes against House Stark by being fed to his own hounds, bringing House Bolton to extinction.","Ramsay Snow is Lord Roose Bolton's bastard son and the product of rape. Years ago, Roose discovered that a miller had wed without his permission. He had the miller hanged and raped his wife. Ramsay is born shortly afterwards, and his mother brought him to the Dreadfort, his father's castle, for Roose to acknowledge as his son. Roose very nearly killed both Ramsay and his mother, but relented upon realizing that the child was indeed his.
Ramsay is Roose's only living child following the death of Domeric Bolton, as well as the only possible heir to House Bolton until the birth of a child by Roose's new wife, Fat Walda Frey. He stays behind as castellan of the Dreadfort when his father left for the south to fight in the War of the Five Kings.
Ramsay keeps a pack of dogs, which he employs for hunting. He is also in a relationship with the kennelmaster's daughter, Myranda, whom he supposedly planned to marry before his father ultimately had him legitimized.","Ramsay is a genuine psychopath. He is sadistic, wild, and completely capable of committing unspeakable atrocities without remorse, simply for pure amusement. Ramsay fully admits - and indeed revels in the fact - that he tortures and kills innocent people for no reason whatsoever, and that they did not deserve what he did to them. It simply made him feel powerful.
Whenever he has the advantage in a skirmish, Ramsay is fearless - almost a beast in human skin - reveling in the violence of personal combat. Ramsay did not rave and rage, however, he had a perverse, playful, childlike giddiness as he inflicts pain on others, from flaying men alive to hunting and killing girls for sport. This behavior, however, was not displayed when Jon Snow proposes that the two of them fight one-on-one rather than send thousands to their deaths to determine who holds sway over The North, Ramsay scoffs at the idea due to his initial numerical superiority, and also strikes anger in Jon and Sansa's hearts by having Smalljon Umber drop Shaggydog's head in front of them to display his power over them mentally and physically. Only when Jon and his allies breach Winterfell thanks to the arrival of the knights of the Vale, does Ramsay reconsider fighting one-on-one against him, choosing a bow and arrows as his weapon but only because he knew he would be quickly killed if he chose to attack the surrounding soldiers whereas he had a better chance of surviving but fighting Jon one-on-one.
In his own twisted way Ramsay is actually quite intelligent, as he possessed a certain ""low cunning"" with which he tricked his enemies. He was particularly good at thinking on his feet, but reckless when it came to long term consequences and intricate politics. Ramsay deeply enjoyed playing mind games with his enemies using psychological torture, often tricking them into trusting him only to then break his empty promises. A good display of Ramsay's deceitful tact was when while playing a ""game"" with Theon Greyjoy to guess where he was, who he was, and why he was being tortured, he allowed him to believe his guesses were correct until he pointed out that Theon ""forgot to ask if he was a liar"" and continued to flay his finger anyway. Another instance is using Rickon Stark as bait to ""trap"" Jon in the middle of the battlefield at the Battle of the Bastards, knowing that his family-loving nature would leave him defenseless to arrow attacks.
On the other hand, Ramsay is very impulsive, not fully considering the long-term consequences of his actions much to his father's chagrin. When Lord Medger Cerwyn refuses to pay Ramsay taxes or even acknowledge Bolton rule, Ramsay flays Cerwyn alive along with his wife and brother while forcing his son to watch, and puts the corpses on public display. Roose angrily warns his son that this disproportionate brutality is severely damaging their long-term position but Ramsay largely ignores his warnings, instead privately holding a massive feast for himself even as other lords are worried about stockpiling provisions for the winter.
Ramsay is greatly frustrated by his bastard status, and was easily angered when he was referred to in such a way. A possible source of this resentment was his jealousy of Jon Snow, another Northern bastard son who was raised by his father, Ned Stark, alongside his trueborn sons and eventually rose to become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and as such, Ramsay desired to rise to a powerful political position as Jon did, which he himself states to Sansa by comparing himself to Jon. Ramsay's jealousy of Jon was so much that he expressed a willingness to kill Jon if the chance comes, though at the same time appears fearful when he hears that Jon may come after him with a wildling army. Due to his immense insecurities about his baseborn status, Ramsay makes it a point to mock and belittle Jon for being a bastard - continuously referring to him as ""bastard"" in both a letter he sends to him at Castle Black, and in person when they finally meet, despite the fact that Ramsay is initially a bastard himself.
Due to having played mind games and tortured helpless and defenseless victims and getting away with it all his life, Ramsay is not used to the possibility of losing a confrontation. Even while being beaten almost to death by Jon, Ramsay smiles with confidence that somehow he will survive, and even displays this behavior when faced with his hungry hounds, who he staunchly believes will never harm him. However, when one of the dogs disobeys his commands to get off him and starts hungrily licking his face, Ramsay's commands get more desperate, and for the first and last time in his life, Ramsay shows genuine fear when he realizes he can't control them and may actually not survive after all.","3, 4, 5, 6","Lord of the Dreadfort, Lord of Winterfell, Lord Paramount of the North, Warden of the North, Castellan of the Dreadfort (formerly)",Deceased,"Executed at the order of Jon Snow; devoured by his own hounds after the, Battle of the Bastards.","Mill along the Weeping Water (birthplace), The Dreadfort (raised)",House Bolton,Northmen,Old Gods of the Forest,Roose Bolton,Sansa Stark (Lady of Winterfell),Roose Bolton,"Miller's wife (biological), Walda Bolton (stepmother)",Sansa Stark (widowed),"","Domeric Bolton (paternal half-brother), Newborn Bolton (paternal half-brother)","Myranda, Violet, Tansy, Kyra",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d2/Ramsay_S06E09_RESZIED_FOR_INFOBOX.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160622071734,Ramsay Bolton,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/bd/Boy.jpg,Ramsay watches Theon's torture while disguised as a servant boy.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/33/Havent-I-been-here-before.jpg,Ramsay reveals his true colors.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/61/BoyflayingTheon-3x06.jpg,Ramsay torments Theon.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/aa/Snow.jpg,"Ramsay renames Theon ""Reek"".",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d0/Ramsay-and-Myranda-402-HD.jpg,Ramsay and Myranda during their hunt of Tansy.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/dd/Reek-and-Ramsay-402.jpg,Ramsay demonstrates Reek's new submissiveness to his father.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/84/Ramsay_and_yara.jpg,"""How fast can you run?""",House Bolton

Orson Lannister,"​Orson Lannister ​is a character mentioned in the fourth season. He is deceased at the start of the series and is not expected to appear. He is a member of House Lannister and a distant cousin to Tyrion, Jaime, and Cersei Lannister.","Orson was born into House Lannister. When he was a baby, a wet nurse dropped him on his head, which apparently caused brain damage and left him simpleminded for all of his life. His relatives would regularly laugh at him due to his handicap, among them his cousins Tyrion and Jaime Lannister. Tyrion admits that he only laughed at Orson because for a moment he could be like everyone else, since he too was an outcast due to being a dwarf.
He would regularly smash beetles with a ​rock in the gardens, leading Tyrion to ask him why, to which Orson only replied unintelligibly. Tyrion then observed Orson every day smashing the beetles, convinced that Orson must have been doing it for a reason. Since Tyrion considered himself to be the smartest person he knew, he thought he could discover the reason for his cousin's behavior. Finding the answer eventually became an obsession to Tyrion: it got to the point where Tyrion could not sleep, having nightmares about Orson's ""relentless beetle slaughter"". Tyrion attempted to stop Orson from smashing any more beetles, but since Orson was twice Tyrion's size, he simply pushed Tyrion away and continued smashing.
Orson was eventually kicked in the chest by a mule and died, leaving the question of why he was smashing all the beetles unsolved.","",4,"",Deceased,Kicked in the chest by a mule,Casterly Rock,House Lannister,Andal,"","","","","","","","","","",Orson Lannister,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","",House Lannister

Viserys, having no sons by his first wife, named Rhaenyra his heir, trained her how to rule and made the Lords of Westeros swear oaths to recognize her as his successor. However, he later remarried and had a son, Aegon. His death sparked a civil war between the half-siblings known as the Dance of Dragons.
Based on the island of Dragonstone, Rhaenyra challenged Aegon's coronation, supported by her sons, husband and the few Lords who had taken her side. Although greatly outnumbered, Rhaenyra had a powerful fleet and a large number of dragons at her disposal. Briefly ousting Aegon from King's Landing and crowning herself Rhaenyra I, she managed to take control of the North, the Riverlands and the Vale, but her support gradually eroded and her husband, as well as most of her children and dragons, were killed in battle. She eventually was defeated and Aegon II had his dragon devour her.

Shae,"Shae is a major character in the second, third, and fourth seasons. She initially appeared as a recurring character in the first season and debuted in ""Baelor."" She is played by starring cast member Sibel Kekilli. Shae is a prostitute who has begun an exclusive relationship with Tyrion Lannister during the time when he was fighting in the Lannister army as part of the Vanguard during the Battle of the Green Fork. When he is sent to King's Landing to be acting Hand of the King, he takes Shae with him as his mistress in defiance of his father's orders, and she lives with him at the Tower of the Hand. The only person who knows she is there is Varys the Master of Whisperers, who while not completely trusted, was an advisor to Tyrion and did keep their secret.
When Shae is bored, Tyrion arranged for her to work as a Handmaiden to Sansa Stark, where she acts as confidant through the difficulties of Joffrey's abuse and the siege of Stannis Baratheon. Queen Cersei is threatening Tyrion and his fear for Shae's safety makes him realize how much he has come to love her. After the Battle of the Blackwater with Tyrion injured and no longer Hand of the King, she urges him to flee with her to Pentos. When he tells her his place is here, she agrees to stay with him. However, their relationship comes under strain when Tyrion is forcibly married to Sansa, inciting Shae's jealousy despite Sansa and Tyrion never consummating their marriage.
Fearing for her safety, Tyrion eventually sends her away, insulting her in the process. However, she is intercepted before leaving the capital and gives vengeful (but false) testimony against Tyrion, whom she considers has betrayed her to remain with Sansa, at his trial for the assassination of King Joffrey, in the process having an affair with Tyrion's father, Tywin. She attempts to kill him, forcing him to kill her in self-defense, breaking him completely. ","Shae is a young woman of mystery, as she won't divulge her true origins. She has a Lorathi accent and is obviously not native to Westeros: she says she arrived there ten years ago. She is first encountered as a camp-follower with the Lannister army in the Riverlands. She has dreams of wealth and power, despite her low social status as a kept woman. She hails from the Free City of Lorath.
At unspecified points in the past, Shae has been to Dorne and Volantis.","Shae began as a curt, willingly mysterious woman with a cynical attitude and a sharp, often biting tongue. Being a prostitute for most of her life, forced to sell her body for men whom treat her like a mindless sex object to survive has left her somewhat jaded as she refuses to say anything about herself or past life and wishes to not care about the concerns or wellbeing of others. It was Tyrion who observed that Shae wanted a different life than the one she had then. Beneath this she is a much more loving, loyal and strong-willed woman who will protect those who treat her well. As stated by others she knows how to defend herself and gets by using her skills in self-defence as well as her voluptuousness and sex appeal.
Up until her betrayal, Shae genuinely cared about other people. Despite her relationship with Tyrion beginning as a customer/employer one they grew to love one another, that being said during their run they did endure tribulations which tested both of their wills. Her decisions to stay with Tyrion even when his face was wounded after the Battle of Blackwater and refusing Varys' offer to leave King's Landing in return for diamonds proves she was not the shallow whore she painted herself out to be. Tyrion's love for Shae was so great that even after she incriminates him at his trial for killing King Joffrey he admits to Tywin that he still loved her. She also grows attached to Sansa Stark as she disguises herself as her handmaiden. She goes as far to threaten a handmaiden with a knife if she told the Queen about her flowering and Sansa felt comfortable confiding her disgust over Joffrey with Shae.
Shae, however, is not without her own insecurities. Although throughout his marriage with Sansa, Tyrion assures that he has no romantic feelings for her whatsoever and even refuses to consummate their wedding she allows her jealousy to get the better of her, feeling envious over Sansa's highborn status and great beauty as Shae a common handmaiden and even worse, whore can not hope to have a relationship with a Lord. Moreover when Tyrion could not leave King's Landing with her as he has to fulfil his duty as a Lannister she believes he enjoys his marriage with her and will forget her eventually. Tyrion preys on these insecurities later on by degrading her as a whore and treating their relationship as if it was another encounter and she leaves King's Landing in tears.
When she did return to the city, her jealousy was replaced by bitterness and anger. With her suspicions over Tyrion and Sansa seemingly confirmed she incriminates the two of them further by saying they planned King Joffrey's assassination together and manipulating his words of love to antagonise and humiliate him during his trial. She goes further by having an affair with his father, Tywin who has an equal amount of hatred for his son and outwardly attacks Tyrion when he finds her in his father's bedchambers either out of fear that he was there to kill her or initial anger. She ends up being strangled with the chains that symbolised their love.","1, 2, 3, 4","",Deceased,Strangled to death by Tyrion,Lorath,"",Lorathi,"","","","","","","","","Tywin Lannister, Tyrion Lannister (formerly)",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/01/Shae_in_Two_Swords.png/revision/latest?cb=20140505142823,Shae,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5a/Shae.jpg,Shae meets Tyrion.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/85/ShaeAndTyrion.jpg,Shae and Tyrion at the castle in King's Landing,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/cc/Shae_threatens.jpg,Shae holds a knife to the throat of the handmaiden.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/be/Tyrion_and_Shae.jpg,"""I am yours"", Tyrion and Shae exchanging words of love.",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/27/Tyrion_and_Shae_in_bed.png,The night before the Battle of the Blackwater.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a7/Shae_and_Tyrion_Scar_2x10.png,"Shae uncovers Tyrion's scar in ""Valar Morghulis""",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/cd/Shae_with_sansa_as_petyr_approaches.png,Shae with Sansa as Petyr approaches.,""

Though he is disliked for bullying and his past as a raper, he is generally treated patiently by Jon Snow, Grenn, Pyp and Eddison Tollett, until he betrays the Night's Watch in the Mutiny at Craster's Keep. Instead of helping defend Craster's Keep with the rest of the Mutineers, Rast instead flees the ongoing battle, allowing his former brothers to be massacred by the Night's Watch before being mauled to death by Ghost, the very animal he tormented.","Rast was forced to join the Night's Watch after being arrested for rape. He chose to take the black over the alternate punishment, castration.","Rast is a former raper who was offered the choice between joining the Night's Watch or facing castration, choosing the former. Due to this, Rast exhibits the typical personality traits of a criminal, and quickly becomes enemies with Jon Snow, and even when Jon trains his fellow recruits in swordsmanship, Rast does not accept Jon as a friend and is still at odds with him, shown most when he jumps at the opportunity to bully the overweight and defenseless Samwell Tarly on Alliser Thorne's orders for his own amusement, stopping only when he is threatened by Jon, Grenn and Pyp with dire consequences if he touches Sam again.
Despite these traits, however, Rast is not without scruples. During his time with the Night's Watch, though he continues to dislike Sam for his cowardice and for surviving the Battle at the Fist of the First Men when braver rangers fought and died, he becomes friends with Grenn and Dolorous Edd, even urging them to leave the exhausted Sam behind since they will die of hypothermia, even though he has the chance to go on ahead without them. At Craster's Keep, he is visibly angered when his fellow ranger Bannen dies of starvation and stands up to Craster for this, and it is this anger at the extreme injustice that drives him to kill Lord Commander Mormont when he threatens to have ranger Karl Tanner executed for murdering Craster (which was in self-defence). After the ensuing mutiny, Rast is visibly uncomfortable under Karl's rule, and appears to be the only one trying to be gentle with Craster's daughter-wives, who are being beaten and raped by the other mutineers.","1, 3, 4",Ranger,Deceased,Savaged by Ghost,"","Betrayers, Night's Watch","","","","","","","","","","",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/61/Rast-S4-EP-04.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140501100824,Rast,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/27/Alliser_and_Rast.png,Alliser and Rast bully Sam.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/2b/Rast_Piggy_and_Mormont.jpg,Rast is forced to be Sam's guardian.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e9/Jeor_Mormont_And_Now_his_watch_is_ended.png,Rast betrays Jeor.,"","","","","","","","",""
Pycelle,"Pycelle is a recurring character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons. He is played by guest star Julian Glover and debuts in ""Lord Snow."" Pycelle was the Grand Maester for multiple kings and a member of the small council, but also served as a spy for Cersei Lannister. He died moments before the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor as a result of a plot orchestrated by Qyburn, a former maester himself, who had his little birds stab Pycelle to death.","Pycelle has been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms for decades and has served under four kings when the series begins. The Grand Maester is the King's personal maester, a learned man wise in history, science and medicine who also provides counsel. The Grand Maester sits on the King's small council, which runs the realm in the name of the King. He served King Aerys II Targaryen prior to Robert's Rebellion. He remembers Aerys as a great man before his descent into madness. When Tywin Lannister marched to the gates of King's Landing following the rebel victory at the Battle of the Trident and all of the King's advisors told Aerys not to trust the Lord of Casterly Rock, Pycelle gave the opposite counsel and the city gates were opened, allowing the Lannister forces to sack the capital.
Following the rebellion he remained Grand Maester to King Robert Baratheon. He is joined on the small council by the Master of Coin Petyr Baelish, also called Littlefinger, the Master of Whisperers Varys, the Master of Ships Stannis Baratheon and the Master of Laws Renly Baratheon. He plays up his age to appear harmless but is actually mentally sharp and dangerous. He is loyal to Queen Cersei Lannister and was involved in the birth of all of her children, assisted by midwives. Pycelle also privately flouts the vow of celibacy taken by maesters, as he enjoys the company of prostitutes such as Ros.","Pycelle is regarded as a cowardly, subservient and extremely sycophantic man by most people, and it is proven that he is so. He is potentially joint in responsibility for the Sacking of King's Landing, as he persuaded the Mad King to open the gates to the capital and allow the Lannister forces to enter and rampage through the city. Pycelle remembers several other rulers, and even remarks to have known Aerys Targaryen before the latter became a psychopathic pyromaniac. Pycelle is viewed by Jaime Lannister as 'a grey, sunken cunt' meaning that he is unpopular amongst most people. This is ironic, because he secretly serves the Lannister House throughout most of the series - specifically, Tywin and Cersei Lannister.
He does not appear to have a strong relationship with the other Lannisters, as he is joined in hating and discriminating Tyrion for his disfigurement and short stature. Despite preaching and claiming to be a man of virtue, Pycelle intentionally usurps and flouts the vow of celibacy by employing prostitutes. Pycelle, despite his extremely frail and absent-minded outlook, is (in his own way) dangerous and surprisingly intelligent and agile, possessing a certain low cunning that other people overlook. He is also firmly opinionated, (rightly) believing that Qyburn's methods are highly unethical, and refers to the latter in diabolical terms. Pycelle is capable of arrogance and cowardice, shown by him desperately blaming Varys when Tyrion accuses him of betraying him to Cersei.
In public, he appears to be clumsy, senile and possessing a constant stammer. When in private, or in the presence of the likes of Tywin Lannister, Pycelle shows that he is actually feigning the stammer in an attempt of being unpredictable. He admits to Tywin that he is ambitious and simply wants to outlast his opponents. However, he is not above being a hypocritical coward, claiming that he serves the Lannisters when he did not hesitate in prosecuting Tyrion. He took the latter incident on an unnecessarily personal level, voicing his belief that his previous arrest by the Imp was unjustified - when, in actuality, it wasn't.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6",Grand Maester,Deceased,Stabbed repeatedly by Qyburn's little birds,"","Order of Maesters, House Lannister, House Baratheon of King's Landing, House Targaryen","","","","","","","","","","",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e9/Pycelle_%28S04E06%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161215030046,Pycelle,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/9b/Aerys_and_Pycelle.jpg,Pycelle advises the Mad King to open the gate to Tywin Lannister.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/ce/Small_Council.png,"Pycelle attends a small council meeting in ""Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things"".",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/26/Pycelle_1x10.png,Pycelle is not as feeble as he appears in public.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5f/WhiteRaven.jpg,Grand Maester Pycelle presents a white raven to the small council.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5a/Tywin_court_2x10.jpg,Pycelle at the court victory ceremony after the Battle of the Blackwater,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b8/SmallCouncil_WoP.jpg,"Grand Maester Pycelle, reinstated to the small council, in ""Walk of Punishment""",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/83/Pycelle_at_joffrey_margaery_wedding.png,Pycelle at Joffrey and Margaery's wedding.,House Lannister

Theon Greyjoy,"Theon Greyjoy is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. He is played by starring cast member Alfie Allen and debuts in the series premiere. Theon is the only living son and heir of Lord Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands, and younger brother of Yara Greyjoy.
Following his father's failed rebellion against the Iron Throne, Theon is taken as a hostage/ward to Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell. After Eddard's execution in King's Landing, Theon pledges his loyalty to Eddard's eldest son, Robb Stark, in the subsequent War of the Five Kings, but ultimately betrays Robb and sides with his father in invading the North, which leads to his capture by House Bolton. He is tortured and forced into servitude by Ramsay Snow, who turns him into a broken pet named Reek. Theon, however, redeems himself by helping Ramsay's wife, Sansa Stark, escape from Winterfell and find refuge with Jon Snow, who later retakes Winterfell and defeats Ramsay. Slowly returning to his former self, Theon returns to the Iron Islands, where he learns of his father's death at the hands of his own uncle, Euron Greyjoy. In retaliation, Theon flees with Yara to seek out an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen in Meereen, where they pledge House Greyjoy's forces to her.","Theon is the youngest son of Lord Balon and Lady Alannys Greyjoy. Balon is the head of House Greyjoy and Lord of the Iron Islands. The Iron Islands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Greyjoy is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Greyjoy rule the region from their seat at Pyke and Balon also holds the title Lord Reaper of Pyke.
Theon was born at Pyke. He is Balon and Alannys's fourth child after Rodrik, Maron, and Yara. Eight years before the start of the series Balon rose in rebellion against the Iron Throne. The ironborn were crushed in a war led by King Robert Baratheon and Lord Eddard Stark. Theon's brothers were both killed in the fighting. Balon surrendered and was allowed to remain Lord of the Iron Islands on the condition that Theon remain a hostage and ward of Eddard Stark. Theon's sister Yara remained on the Iron Islands. Despite his status as a hostage at Winterfell, Theon was treated well by the Starks, and he came to see Eddard as a surrogate father, while becoming best friends with Robb Stark and forming a friendly rivalry with Jon Snow. Theon is a skilled archer. His cocky arrogance and cavalier actions contrast with the staid ways of the North.","Before his capture by Ramsay Snow, Theon is shown to be rather arrogant, narcissistic and vain, but fundamentally not malicious. He expected acclaim in a multitude of situations even if he were the only one expecting acclaim for it - when he shot a wildling to save Bran, his perspective believed that he had simply saved Bran's life and not risked hitting Bran with the arrow, and also when he returned to the Iron Islands he expected to be coated in glory for being allegedly the only living heir of Balon Greyjoy. He was both baffled and offended that he did not receive a hero's welcome back to Pyke. Beneath his confident exterior, however, he is insecure, weak, and unsure of himself. This stems particularly from the fact that he was raised by the Stark family since he was nine years old as their ward/hostage after his father's failed rebellion against Robert Baratheon, and while he grew up with the Stark children and at at their table, he was always reminded in some way that he was not truly part of the family.
This subject is shown to irritate Theon greatly, demonstrated when Ros and Tyrion Lannister mention it. His insecurity also leads him to question which is his true family: the Starks or the Greyjoys. Though his father Balon and sister Yara are initially successful at using it to sway Theon to their side when Balon decides to fight the Starks instead of aid them against the Lannisters, this still causes a great deal of conflict in Theon. The ironborn are unapologetic about attacking and stealing from others, ""paying the iron price"" as they call it, but Ned Stark set the example for Theon that other people should be dealt with according to a basic code of honor and justice. Theon tries to become a ruthless ironborn raider to appease his biological father and find a true home again, but the conscience that he developed living with the Starks makes it difficult for him to live up to these expectations.
It is only after Theon becomes a prisoner of the Boltons and realizes that his father has no intention of rescuing him that he admits, to himself and to Ramsay Snow, that Ned Stark was his ""real father"", and laments Ned's execution in King's Landing. Even throughout Theon's capture of Winterfell, he is shown to be in a constant battle with himself, implying that he knows deep down that invading his childhood home for his father was far from right. Maester Luwin even points out to Theon that all of this is just an act to live up to his father's expectations, and that Theon himself must know that his betrayal at Winterfell is wrong. Theon resignedly admits to Luwin that he is correct, but that he can't stop because he has already come too far to be forgiven, and refuses to join the Night's Watch, where all of his crimes would be forgiven, out of shame (and partially out of fear that Jon Snow might kill him in retribution for allegedly murdering Bran and Rickon).
After being tortured by Ramsay Snow in the dungeons of the Dreadfort for over a year, Theon's original personality has been seemingly obliterated, and he is little more than a broken and half-insane prisoner. Among various tortures, Ramsay cut off several of his fingers and toes, flayed off sections of his skin, and even cut off his genitals. Ramsay even mockingly renamed him ""Reek"", physically and psychologically torturing him to accept it as his name, and deny that he ever was ""Theon Greyjoy"". Ramsay also psychologically tortured him with fake escape attempts or promises of rescue, before recapturing him, so now Reek thinks any possibility of escape or fighting back against Ramsay is simply another ruse. He lives in great fear of Ramsay, desperate to avoid angering him, and is in such a state of traumatic shock that he is very withdrawn and submissive.
However, despite his previous actions, Reek appears to have retained a strong love and loyalty to the remaining Starks, demonstrated on several occasions: he is visibly shocked when Ramsay gloats about Robb's death, briefly holding a razor to Ramsay's neck and appearing on the verge of slitting his throat (though he doesn't because Roose and Locke are present); he appears hesitant about telling them that Bran and Rickon may be sheltering at Castle Black with Jon Snow, knowing that it may lead to their deaths (even though Theon was never as close with Jon as with the other Stark children, there still seemed to be a certain degree of friendship between the two to the point that Theon didn't want Jon to get hurt); he silently cries and briefly looks angry when Ramsay rapes Sansa, and does his best (or what he thinks is the best) to keep Sansa from angering Ramsay and suffering more at his hands, and even goes as far as to confess to Sansa that he deserved what he suffered under Ramsay and that he deserved to be Reek for what he did to the Stark family. However, when pushed too far, Theon ultimately abandons his Reek persona and chooses his loyalty to the Starks over Ramsay, by killing Myranda and helping Sansa escape from Winterfell, though still believing himself unworthy of anyone's forgiveness for betraying the Starks, effectively the only ones who ever treated him like family.
Despite his loyalty to House Stark, Theon still expresses shock after learning of his father's death. Despite falling out of his sister Yara's favor following the failed Dreadfort rescue attempt, brother and sister reconcile when Theon offers to support Yara's claim to the Salt Throne. While initially despondent, Theon regains some of his bravado during the Kingsmoot to select the next ruler of the Iron Islands. Giving a brief rousing speech, he manages to convince many of the gathered Ironborn to join him in supporting his sister's claim to the Salt Throne, his speaking skills demonstrating that ""Reek"" has all but been obliterated for good and Theon Greyjoy restored, though he and Yara are outmanuevered by Euron, who wins many over by offering to seal an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen.
After escaping Euron with his sister Yara, Theon slides back into his despondent state and is troubled by his role in the death of the orphan boys; believing that he should hang for his crimes. Yara counsels him to rediscover himself so that they can secure an alliance with Daenerys and retake the Iron Islands from their uncle Euron. While negotiating with Daenerys, Theon does not display reluctance for the Ironborn to cease raping, pillaging and reaving, and nods at Yara to tell her to agree with Daenerys, demonstrating that despite his recovery, he is still greatly traumatized by his torture by Ramsay, and apparently wishes to lead a more peaceful life in order to prevent it from happening again, though it is currently unknown whether or not Theon knows of Ramsay's death, or how he will react when he hears of it.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7",Prince of Winterfell (formerly),Alive,"",Pyke,House Greyjoy,Ironborn,Drowned God,"","",Balon Greyjoy,Alannys Greyjoy,"","","Rodrik Greyjoy, Maron Greyjoy, Yara Greyjoy","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/65/605_Theon_Promo_new.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160708203536,Theon Greyjoy,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/8f/Young_Theon.png,Theon becomes Ned Stark's ward after his father's failed rebellion.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/81/Theon_Greyjoy.png,Theon Greyjoy passing the greatsword Ice to Lord Eddard Stark.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3f/Jon%2C_Robb_and_Theon_1x01.png,"Theon, Jon and Robb talk about Queen Cersei as they prepare for the royal party in ""Winter is Coming"".",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/36/Theon_attacks_Osha.png,Theon prepares to kill Osha.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/84/Theon-fealty.png,Theon swears fealty to Robb.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/39/Yara.png,"Theon unknowingly attempts to seduce his own sister in ""The Night Lands"".",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/24/Theon_and_Bran.jpg,Theon tells Bran to yield Winterfell,House Greyjoy

Waif,"The Waif is a recurring character in the fifth and sixth seasons.

Her jealous stepmother then tried to poison her. The woman who became the Waif discovered this plot and sought the help of the Faceless Men. She subsequently found her way to the House of Black and White in Braavos. Since the point of the Game of Faces is to mix lies with the truth convincingly, we can presume that parts of her story were false and other parts were true.","The Waif was fundamentally a cruel and pitiless individual. She had a cold disposition that seldom broke, but did nothing whatsoever to conceal her violent and vindictive mentality, which she mostly directed at Arya Stark. Much like Jaqen H'ghar, she was stony and calm in demeanour, but unlike the older man she did not bother to hide her capacity for brutality to the people she disliked - that being said, she was visibly frightened and subservient to Jaqen. She condescended Arya continuously, and also proved to be sadistic towards her when Arya was blinded, taunting her with the fact that her blindness prevented her from being talked to by everyone else around her. When Arya was blinded, she took the opportunity to use the Stark girl's Faceless Men training as an excuse to beat and abuse her for her own satisfaction, and she proved angry and humiliated when Arya began to match her. Her sadistic streak was also prominent in the way she violently killed Lady Crane and later taunted Arya with the prospect that Crane's death could have been avoided by Arya's own.","5, 6","",Deceased,Killed by Arya Stark using Needle,Braavos,Faceless Men,Braavosi,Many-Faced God,"","","","","","","","",http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4c/Waif6x08.png/revision/latest?cb=20160609061651,Waif,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/be/Arya-attacked.jpg,Arya is accosted by The Waif,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a0/The_Broken_Man_25.jpg,The Waif stabs Arya,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4b/Waiif_No_One_ep.jpg,The Waif chasing down Arya through the city.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/98/Waifs_face_no_one_ep.jpg,The Waif's face in the Hall of Faces.,"","","","","","",""

Jaime Lannister,"Ser Jaime Lannister is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. He is played by starring cast member Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and debuts in the series premiere.
Jaime is the eldest son of Tywin, younger twin brother of Cersei, and older brother of Tyrion Lannister. He is also involved in an incestuous relationship with Cersei and is the biological father of her three children, Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen.
Jaime previously served in the Kingsguard of Aerys Targaryen, known as the Mad King, before infamously backstabbing him during the Sack of King's Landing, earning Jaime the nickname of the Kingslayer. He continued to serve in the Kingsguard of Robert Baratheon, and as Lord Commander for Robert's alleged sons Joffrey and Tommen. However, a confrontation with the Faith of the Seven led to his dismissal from the sworn order.","Ser Jaime Lannister was a knight of the Kingsguard, a position he held since he was a teenager, until he was dismissed by his son and nephew, King Tommen Baratheon. He was then the youngest man ever appointed to its membership. He was appointed to the position by the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen during the Tourney at Harrenhal.
At the conclusion of Robert's Rebellion, Jaime's father Tywin arrived at the gates of King's Landing with the main Lannister army, pledging his allegiance. Most of the Small Council urged Aerys not to trust Tywin, especially Jaime, knowing his father would never support the losing side of a war. Instead, Grand Maester Pycelle gave the opposite counsel, and once the Lannister army was allowed inside, Tywin ordered his men to attack the city. As Lannister soldiers raped and pillaged throughout the city during the Sack of King's Landing, King Aerys remained holed up inside the Red Keep, for hours maniacally repeating the order to ""burn them all"". Despite being sworn by the holiest oaths to protect the king as a member of the Kingsguard, Jaime ultimately turned his own sword on Aerys, slaying him at the foot of the Iron Throne itself. For this infamous act, he is known throughout the Seven Kingdoms as the ""Kingslayer"", to his irritation.  Jaime always refused to discuss precisely what happened the day he slew the Mad King, and thus his true motivations – and what plans Aerys had for King's Landing – were never revealed. On one occasion he confides the truth to Brienne of Tarth: Aerys' final orders were for Jaime to kill his father, and to burn the entire city and its inhabitants with wildfire. Unwilling to let that happen, Jaime killed him, and in doing so actually saved thousands of innocent lives. He adds that the ""honorable"" Ned Stark judged him guilty on the spot, without giving Jaime a chance to explain.He was forgiven for breaking his vows by King Robert Baratheon and permitted to remain in the Kingsguard as part of Robert's alliance with House Lannister, along with the marriage of Jaime's twin sister Cersei to Robert. In addition to the slaying of the Mad King, Jaime is known for his handsome looks, arrogant demeanor, and superb martial skills. He is so skilled with a sword that he claims that there are only three men in the seven kingdoms who may have a chance at beating him in a fair duel.
Jaime is the eldest son of Joanna Lannister and Lord Tywin Lannister. Tywin is the head of House Lannister, the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms and Lord Paramount of the Westerlands. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Jaime had great difficulty learning to read as a child because he transposed letters in his mind. Tywin sat with him through four hours a day practicing until he learned. Jaime resented being forced to spend so much time on reading.
Jaime is the older brother of Tyrion and the twin brother of Cersei. Their mother died giving birth to Tyrion. Due to his place in the Kingsguard, Jaime cannot inherit his father's lands or titles, making Tyrion his father's heir; a fact which vexes Tywin. Unlike Cersei and Tywin, Jaime always treated Tyrion with a degree of kindness and respect. In a secret known to only a few, Jaime is Cersei's lover and the biological father of her children, Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen, whom the world believes are Robert's kin.","At first glance, outsiders perceive Jaime to be arrogant, disdainful, and sarcastic. To a large extent he is arrogant about his own abilities, but not without cause. Even his enemies admit that he is arguably the greatest living swordsman in Westeros with few able to match him. Jaime's loss of his sword-hand did much to humble him, given that in many ways he was that hand and how much his self-identity depended on his skills with a sword. Jaime does not mock others over minor insults the way Cersei does, and he can muster up polite behavior, but he is usually very blunt. Much like his brother Tyrion, he typically just says what he is thinking, and has no reservations about mocking those he perceives as incompetent. Despite this, there were men that Jaime admired (like Ser Barristan Selmy, for whom he squired) and, underneath this cold and sarcastic attitude, Jaime is a very complicated man.
Tywin Lannister has raised Jaime and Cersei with the principle of ruthlessness as a virtue. Yet even though Jaime Lannister often behaves unapologetically amoral, in his own warped way, Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family (Tywin and his three children) aside from Tyrion who shows any hint of honor or principles, whilst Tywin claims to see family as his highest priority but simultaneously is willing to have Tyrion, whom he views as an incalculable disgrace, killed, and Cersei herself ironically sees no immorality whatsoever in anything she does. This is largely based on his arrogance and pride at being a member of the Kingsguard. Jaime became extremely disillusioned with ideals of honor and loyalty when he saw firsthand the atrocities committed by the Mad King, how other ""honorable"" members of the Kingsguard stood by and did nothing while King Aerys had people burned alive for imagined insults, because they felt bound by vows of faith and fealty - in this sense, Jaime is surprisingly similar to Sandor Clegane, since they both have powerful disillusionments about honor and nobility.
A key difference between Cersei and Jaime is that Cersei honestly believes, in her skewed view of the world, that she is ""good"", Joffrey is a great king, and all of her enemies are ""evil"" people trying to destroy her and her children. In contrast, Jaime does not maintain any pretense of being a ""good"" or honorable man, as he has become apathetic to such concerns - this was influenced by him being hated and loathed by everyone because he killed a man who had infamously terrorized the Seven Kingdoms, opening his eyes to how people perceive goodness and honor. However, he still refused to kill Ned Stark when their duel ended abruptly, since Ned was incapacitated by an opportunistic guard rather than Jaime himself. This may or may not be considered mercy or honor, because the alternative would be Jaime shamelessly killing Ned Stark in what had thus far been an honorable duel - indeed, the best duel he had probably in a long time.
Moreover, Jaime isn't a very politically ambitious man, much to Cersei's annoyance, and often turns down her frequent urgings that he should try to become Hand of the King, stating that the days are too long and their lives are too short. Political maneuvering is not his way, and he sees himself foremost as a soldier who when confronted with a problem takes out his sword and cuts its head off. Up until the day his hand was cut off, he had immersed himself in combat so much that it is his sole value, and when he does lose his hand, his sword hand, he loses the will to live because, thus far, he has only ever had to decapitate a problem so as not to face it again, but now he cannot wield a sword the same way ever again - he laments that he was that hand. Brienne of Tarth is quick to tirade to him about him having a small taste of a world where people have their good things ripped from their possession, and after that one small taste he gives up - she mistakes him for a coward at this point. Indeed, Jaime's lack of political thinking leads to him heatedly suggesting that either he or someone else execute the High Sparrow and his followers for manipulating Tommen - at the time, he did not quite see the long term ramifications of such an act because he was angry at the possibility of losing his only surviving child.
Jaime is the only member of Tyrion's immediate family who ever treated him with respect or kindness. In fact, he admires Tyrion's intellect and his ability to tell off those who insult him. Jaime never approved of Tywin and Cersei's long history of abuse towards Tyrion, and has always treated him like a brother. Indeed, Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family who has a reasonably good relationship with all of the others. Among the three siblings, Cersei and Tyrion can't stand each other, but they both like Jaime (both Cersei and Tyrion have acknowledged the only reason they haven't gone out of their way to seriously harm or kill each other is because Jaime would never forgive them if they did). However, in recent times, Jaime's good relationship with Tyrion seems to have died with their father, and Jaime said he would kill Tyrion the next time they meet (though it is unclear if he really meant it). His relationship with Cersei has also deteriorated in the aftermath of Tywin's death since it was Jaime who set Tyrion free and inadvertently allowed him to kill their father.
Tywin is a stern man feared and resented by all of his children, ignoring Cersei for her gender and scorning Tyrion for both his stature and killing his wife in childbirth. However, Jaime is on reasonably good terms with Tywin - not so much that he is ""proud"" of Jaime so much as he has the ""least shame"" for him compared to his brother and sister. Even so, Tywin is upset that Jaime willingly joined the Kingsguard, as while it is considered the highest honor for a knight, its members give up the rights to marry or inherit lands, meaning that Jaime cannot be Tywin's heir. Jaime wasn't in a position to act as a father to his biological children with Cersei, though he is generally supportive of Tommen and Myrcella. However, in sharp contrast with Cersei, Jaime isn't particularly fond of Joffrey, nor will he defend his actions the way Cersei does. He shows obvious joy when Myrcella reveals her knowledge that Jaime is her father and is happy about it, and embraces her, since this is the first time he has ever been able to show his feelings as a father to his children. He is equally saddened when Myrcella dies in his arms moments later.
Jaime's attitude towards violence is also complex: he threw Bran Stark out a tower window to kill him, but later saved Brienne twice (from being raped, then fed to a bear) from Locke's soldiers. The difference seems to be that after witnessing the depravations of the Mad King, needless violence and brutality deeply offend Jaime, though if he decides that violence and murder are absolutely necessary he will ruthlessly carry it out himself. He threw Bran out of a window because had the boy reported that he saw the incest between Jaime and his sister, Cersei, the woman he loved, then all of their children would be executed, so he felt he had no choice.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","Ser, Lord Commander of the, Kingsguard (formerly)",Alive,"",Casterly Rock,"House Lannister, Kingsguard",Andal,"",Barristan Selmy (as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard),"",Tywin Lannister,Joanna Lannister,"","Joffrey Baratheon, Myrcella Baratheon, Tommen Baratheon","Cersei Lannister, Tyrion Lannister",Cersei Lannister,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c5/Jaime_s6_Ep08_.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161215030911,Jaime Lannister,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/26/Ser_Jaime_swore_to_the_Mad_King.png,"The Mad King, Aerys II, proclaims Jaime to his Kingsguard.",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/89/Jamie_Stabs_Aerys.jpg,Jaime slays the Mad King.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3c/Jamienadbran.png,"Jaime confronts Bran, before pushing him out a window.",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/34/Jaime_1x02.png,Tyrion ponders the circumstances of Bran's fall with an uneasy Jaime and Cersei.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/bf/Jaime_and_Cersei_1x03.png,Jaime comforts Cersei.,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/05/Jaime_Lannister_and_Barristan_Selmy.jpg,Jaime stands alongside Ser Barristan.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/67/Eddard_Jaime_Confrontation.jpg,Jaime confronts Eddard Stark in King's Landing.,House Lannister

Gregor married Elissa Branfield, a daughter of Southron Targaryen loyalists, before Robert Baratheon seized the Iron Throne Gregor ascended to the lordship after his father died at the Trident, and has led House Forrester for sixteen years.
He is the father of six healthy children borne by Elissa Forrester: Rodrik, Asher, Mira, Ethan, Talia and Ryon.
It was later revealed that Gregor also fathered two secret bastards, Josera Snow and Elsera Snow. He sent them to the North Grove for unknown reasons. Their mother's identity is unknown and none of his family are aware of their existence.
One day, while supplicating at Ironrath, Duncan Tuttle struck up an unlikely friendship with Gregor, the then heir to House Forrester. The two grew close, sharing food, drink, and women, and when Gregor became lord he named Duncan his castellan. . After seeing his exploits in the Greyjoy Rebellion, Lord Forrester asked Ser Royland Degore to serve as Ironrath's master-at-arms.
At the Tourney at Lannisport, Gregor met Tyrion Lannister, and the two struck up a brief conversation, during which Tyrion found him very honorable, and even then he didn't trust Roose Bolton.
His son Asher had always been a rebellious youth, finding ways to raise his father's ire.

Bloodshed ensued and Lord Forrester faced a grim choice: go to war, or exile Asher across the Narrow Sea. He chose the latter. He privately named that event his life's only regret.
After Robb Stark called his banners to war, Lord Forrester asked Rodrik to stay behind and protect Ironrath; but Rodrik would have none of it. Instead, he rode off at his father's side and led the Forrester cavalry with such valor that his name came to be feared amongst the ranks of Lannister soldiers.  When the war began, Ryon was too young to understand why Rodrik and his father were leaving home.  Duncan's nephew Gared Tuttle, began to work in Lord Forrester's stables, rising through the ranks to be eventually named his squire.

High Sparrow,"The ""High Sparrow"" is a major character in the sixth season. He initially appeared as a recurring character in the fifth season. He is played by starring cast member Jonathan Pryce and debuts in the eponymous ""High Sparrow"". The High Sparrow is the leader of the religious sect known as the Sparrows and is the newly appointed High Septon. Under his tenure as High Septon, the Faith Militant is reestablished, and the Faith amasses considerable influence over the Iron Throne during the reign of King Tommen I. His real name is unknown. The High Sparrow is immensely serious, threatening, and only occasionally tender.","The man who would become the High Sparrow was born to a fairly well off cobbler. After his father's passing, the young Sparrow continued and greatly improved the family business. Many highborn citizens sought out his wares and were happy to pay hefty sums. In turn, the man took extreme pride in his work, often spending night and day crafting a pair of shoes. The Sparrow became ever richer and adopted an extravagant lifestyle. He sought to distance himself from his humble roots and thus began to mimic the nobility who bought from him. The soon to be septon was known for giving lavish parties that ended in debauchery. After one such night with too much wine and women, the Sparrow woke up at the crack of dawn. Ashamed of what he had devolved into, the Sparrow up and left his life, not even bothering to put on his shoes. He began to minister to the less fortunate because he now felt they were closer to the Seven than anyone.
He became a humble septon out in the countryside who began to preach equality among all men and aid the poor while leading a humble life himself, often denouncing the excesses and sins of the nobility. He and his followers began to speak out against the suffering inflicted on the smallfolk by the feuding noble families in the War of the Five Kings. As followers gathered around him, he made his way to King's Landing.
He emerged as more or less the leader of the religious protest movement known as ""the Sparrows"", and his critics started mockingly calling him the ""High Sparrow"" - in sarcastic comparison to the High Septon, the highest cleric and ordained leader of the Faith of the Seven. His followers, however, adopted the nickname in pride, and themselves started calling him ""the High Sparrow"" as a sign of respect. He never tried to call himself this, but the name stuck. After being made High Septon, as per tradition it became forbidden to ever refer to him by his given name again, so whatever his original name was remains unknown.
Although the High Sparrow seems a harmless old man, he has a will of steel. Though his devotion to the Seven is genuine, he is also a deeply ambitious man, seeking to obtain political power in order to enforce what he sees as the will of the Gods on the populace, whether they want to or not.","The High Sparrow presents himself as humble, pious and wise. He is unmoved by life's luxuries and abjures materialism. While some other septons are indifferent toward the small-folk and their problems, the High Sparrow consistently shows concern and compassion.
However, behind a harmless facade, he is ruthless and fanatical in his beliefs as well as a shrewd and highly intelligent political player and Machiavellian with a keen and personal understanding of the narcissistic mindsets of many of the political players of Kings Landing. He manipulates Cersei's resentment toward Margaery to gain control of King's Landing through the Faith Militant. Later, he gains influence over the naive and weak-willed King Tommen Baratheon, obtaining even more power through deliberate manipulation and exploitation of the young king. He also psychologically tortured Cersei, Loras, and Margaery to obtain a confession on their ""sins"".
It's unclear if he really believes in his piety or if his humility is only a facade to obtain power. He has shown to display a smug smile when he knows he has the upper hand in a conflict, and he displays a rather arrogant certainty in his interpretation of the will of the Gods. Even if this is so, whether he does it for a genuine greater good strengthened by faith or for his own political agenda and hubris - perhaps a combination thereof, as is often the case with those of similar ambitions - is unclear. Despite this, he appears to be unafraid of death, remaining calm when Jaime threatens to cut him down, though this could just be because he gauged, quite correctly, that Jaime would not kill him if it were to mean his own death afterwards although he did seem shocked when he discovered that Cersei had laced the Great Sept of Baelor with wildfire just before his death.
However, despite his brilliant manipulations and his army of followers, the High Sparrow's blind devotion ultimately led to his death. As Cersei put it; because he had no use for anything in the material world, he was unafraid of any threat the material world could produce. Somewhat similar to Daario Naharis's taunt against Grey Worm, a lack of fear limits a person's understanding as to how scared people think, thus making it difficult for them to manipulate those people. The High Sparrow was over-confident that Cersei was powerless against himself and his followers. Therefore, he was unable to comprehend how extreme her actions would become in order to eliminate them (i.e. blowing up the Sept of Baelor with wildfire and killings dozens - if not hundreds - of innocent people in the process).","5, 6",High Septon,Deceased,Burned alive in a wildfire explosion ignited by Qyburn; orchestrated by Cersei Lannister,"","Sparrows, Faith Militant","",Faith of the Seven,High Septon after the Riot of King's Landing,"","","","","","","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3b/Blood_of_My_Blood_16.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160527164016,High Sparrow,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1a/High_Sparrow_Season_6_Blood_Of_My_Blood.jpg,"",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/83/Cersei_and_High_Sparrow-5x03.jpg,Cersei visits the High Sparrow.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/24/Cersei_high_sparrow_Sons_of_the_Harpy.jpg,The High Sparrow is informed of Loras' homosexuality.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d8/The_gods_demand_justice.png,Olenna confronts the High Sparrow in the Great Sept of Baelor.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a4/Mother%E2%80%99s_Mercy_03.jpg,"Cersei confesses to some of her sins, leading to the High Sparrow's demand of atonement.",http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b1/Home_07.jpg,The High Sparrow interrupts Myrcella's funeral.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3b/Blood_of_My_Blood_16.jpg,The High Sparrow tells Margaery of how he found his faith.,""

Cersei Lannister,"Queen Cersei I Lannister is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. She is portrayed by starring cast member Lena Headey and debuts in the series premiere. Cersei is the widow of King Robert Baratheon and Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. She is the daughter of Lord Tywin Lannister, twin sister of Jaime Lannister and elder sister of Tyrion Lannister. She has an incestuous relationship with Jaime, who is secretly the father of her three children, Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen.
After the assassinations of Joffrey and Myrcella and Tommen's suicide in the wake of the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, Cersei assumed the throne under the name of Cersei of the House Lannister, the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms. ","Cersei is the only daughter and eldest child of Lord Tywin Lannister and his wife Joanna Lannister, who was also his cousin. Tywin is the head of House Lannister, the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms and Lord Paramount of the Westerlands. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Cersei is the elder twin of Ser Jaime Lannister and the elder sister of Tyrion Lannister. She was raised in privilege in the family seat of Casterly Rock. She is noted for her great beauty.
Cersei's mother died when she was four years old, after giving birth to her younger brother Tyrion. Like her father, Cersei has always blamed Tyrion for her mother's death and deeply resents that her mother died so that Tyrion would be brought into the world. As for Cersei's father Tywin, he was constantly away from home during her childhood and teenage years, serving as Hand of the King at the capital, with only infrequent visits back to his seat at Casterly Rock. Coupled with the death of her mother, this meant that Cersei and her two brothers were primarily raised by servants attached to House Lannister. She began an incestuous relationship with Jaime in her youth which has continued despite her marriage. While Cersei has had other partners, Jaime has always kept himself strictly for her.
When she was about fifteen, Cersei and her friend Melara visited Maggy, a woods witch and reputed fortune teller dwelling in a hut deep in a forest close to Casterly Rock. Melara was reluctant, but Cersei convinced her to go. After rudely awakening her and insisting on having her future foretold, Maggy tasted a drop of her blood and revealed to Cersei she wouldn't marry ""the Prince"" but ""the King"", and while the king would have twenty sons, she would bear only three children who will wear golden crowns as well as golden shrouds. Finally, she revealed to Cersei that although she would indeed be Queen, she would be cast down by another, younger and more beautiful queen.
After the end of the civil war which ended the reign of House Targaryen, Cersei was married to King Robert Baratheon, a political marriage Robert agreed to in thanks for her father's last-minute alliance. She was only 19 when she married Robert and became Queen. At first, Cersei was infatuated with the handsome Robert, but their love begun to wane when he called her ""Lyanna"" on their wedding night. She nevertheless bore Robert a son who died shortly after his birth. Cersei was devastated by the loss of her son and refused to have the body taken from her, forcing Robert to hold her while they took her son from her. In time, Cersei's feelings for Robert turned to hatred and she returned to her brother as a result. Her three children, Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen, are officially Robert's, but in reality are the products of her incestuous relationship with Jaime.","Cersei is ruthless, willful, cold, ambitious, and cunning in the sense that she is utterly willing to betray anyone who trusts her, or do anything to protect her own. However, she is also arrogant and self-centered to a fault. While she certainly believes herself to be a master strategist, she is extremely impatient, short-sighted, and prone to displays of poor judgment and poor leadership, resulting in her being both unskilled at manipulating enemies who openly distrust her and incapable of thinking about the long-term consequences of her actions. Cersei's own father Tywin stated to her that he distrusts her because she isn't nearly as intelligent as she believes herself to be. This makes for a dangerous combination, as not only is Cersei not as intelligent as she thinks, but she does not even realize her own limitations.
Cersei's schemes may initially work but they have a tendency to backfire on her. She was partially successful in her scheme to have Ned Stark falsely confess to treason before exiling him to the Wall in order to keep the North and the Riverlands in line. However, just as Ned had failed to predict that Cersei would be unreasonable enough to refuse his offer of mercy when he confronted her with the truth about her children's parentage, Cersei failed to predict Joffrey would be so foolish as to start a war by having Ned executed instead. Her scheme to undermine the Tyrells' plot to marry Loras to Sansa backfires on her when Tywin insists that Cersei will marry Loras instead, and coerces the Tyrells into consenting by threatening to have Loras appointed to the Kingsguard if they don't. After Tywin's death, she thinks she can co-opt the Sparrows into undermining the Tyrells, which briefly succeeds by having Loras and then Margaery imprisoned by the Faith Militant, but this plan ultimately backfired on her as well when she too was imprisoned and force to perform a walk of atonement. Finally, Cersei's plan to destroy the Faith Militant and the Tyrells backfires on her as well with the suicide of Tommen, her last living child.
A mistake outsiders often make when dealing with Cersei is assuming that she has the emotional maturity and wisdom of a queen, or at least an adult, when her real personality is closer to a petulant child inhabiting an adult's body (indeed, Lena Headey has stated that she plays Cersei as having the mind of a wayward 15 year old who never had any real parenting). With her mother dead at a young age and her father away at court (and a cold disciplinarian anyway), Cersei was functionally raised by servants. In public, Cersei often tries to exude a sense of calm and regal control over her surroundings. When things do not go her own way, however, Cersei's usual response is to become childishly flippant, even when the assembled Small Council is trying to give her advice which would genuinely serve her own interests. She also has a tendency to irrationally blame other people for problems she actually started herself though her ego won't let her admit otherwise.
Cersei's behavior is very mercurial, capable of switching between seemingly true affection for someone to extreme loathing over trifles. She is very petty about even small slights, both real and imagined, which ended up being her undoing, for she tried to use the Faith Militant to undermine House Tyrell due to her dislike of Margaery and the fact she replaced her as Queen, only to lose House Tyrell as an ally and find a powerful enemy in the Faith Militant. As Tyrion noted, Cersei often uses her honest feelings to dishonestly manipulate other people. For example, her fear for the safety of her children is actually genuine, but she will shamelessly use this to play on the sympathy of other people, to sway them into supporting her.
Cersei despises the restraints placed on her because she is a woman and is jealous of the freedoms that men have in her society. Several of the noble Houses in the Seven Kingdoms have more liberal attitudes when it comes to involving female members of their family in politics. The women of House Tyrell, for example, are expected to be involved in politics and have thus been trained from a young age in the skills of ruling. Unfortunately, Cersei's father Tywin is a staunch conservative, and never envisioned Cersei playing an active role in politics. Instead, her duty was to cement a marriage alliance and raise royal children, nothing more. It is also possible that instead of her gender being the object, Tywin believes she is simply too impatient and rash. Either way, the practical result is that, right or wrong, Tywin didn't raise Cersei to be skilled in ruling or in political intrigue. While confronted with these shortfalls, Cersei often blames her father or society in general for not giving her the years of training needed to rule, but complaining about it doesn't change the fact that she simply doesn't possess these skills. Cersei hates being a woman in Westerosi society, and scorns other women in general for what she perceives as their weakness: Cersei isn't so much angry at men for mistreating women, as angry that she isn't a man. When she was drunk during the Battle of the Blackwater she even openly said she wished she was born a man.
Cersei's lack of a parental relationship growing up is reflected in how poorly she has served as a mother to her own children, for whom she is unable to act as a stable moral instructor. While she certainly dotes on them, she doesn't genuinely ""love"" them so much as she treats them as extensions of herself. She is convinced that she is obsessed with their welfare, but when events threaten to take any of them away from her she is not so much worried about their happiness and well-being as angered that something she feels belongs to her is being taken away.
Tyrion once observed that Cersei's love for her children is her one obvious redeeming quality - but she even managed to twist this into a negative. Cersei doesn't really ""love"" her children so much as she is obsessed with her mental constructs of them. She spent Joffrey's entire childhood convinced that he was going to grow up to be the best king ever, wise and brave - to the point that she blinded herself to his obviously psychopathic behaviour. However, in spite of her obvious favoritism and far from realistic conception of her son, she at least acknowledged that Joffrey was indeed a monster after his death, implying she wasn't as deluded as she appeared. Her overindulgence of Joffrey also spoiled him rotten, filling him with an insatiable sense of entitlement - nor did he particularly give her much respect in return. Meanwhile, Cersei seems oblivious to the fact that she ignored her two younger children, Myrcella and Tommen. While Cersei is constantly upset that her own father Tywin played favorites with his children and focused all of his attention on her brother Jaime, she hypocritically visited the same treatment on her own children. She fixated on Joffrey so much that she barely knew Myrcella and Tommen, rarely engaging them in conversation except when she needed to manipulate them. After Myrcella was sent away to Dorne in a marriage-alliance, Cersei assumed she was suffering away from her family, not suspecting that Myrcella would actually find happiness once she was free from Cersei's control and not even want to come back to her. After spending some years in Dorne away from her, Myrcella outright said that Cersei doesn't even know her. Finally, after the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, Cersei tells a captured Unella, she was motivated by protecting her last living child, Tommen. However, Cersei once again proves what a poor parent she is by not going immediately to Tommen after his wife is killed in the explosion and preventing his suicide as she was too preoccupied with paying back Unella for imprisoning and humiliating her.
After she was humiliated by the Faith Militant, the megalomania and vengefulness Cersei possessed all her life reached its peak. Combined with the rage she felt for her Uncle Kevan and the fact that Olenna Tyrell and Grand Maester Pycelle deprived her of power, Cersei began plotting with Qyburn to avoid her trial, simultaneously destroy her enemies, including the High Sparrow and Queen Margaery. This ended up destroying the alliance with the Tyrells, the only effective ally to King's Landing and a bloody revolt is to be expected by a vindictive Olenna. Cersei, however, does not seem concerned regarding this, displaying much more recklessness and slight mental imbalance on her part. Despite declaring herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, the title is effectively meaningless as currently the only major houses supporting her are her own and the Freys, although with the death of Walder Frey as well as the Freys' apparent military incompetence, they are unlikely to be useful allies. Along with the Lannisters now pitted against the rest of the great houses of Westeros, there is also the matter of the Crown's debt to the Iron Bank which has still not been resolved. So while Cersei might have achieved her ultimate ambition of being crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, she is still in an incredibly precarious situation. However, this appears lost on her, further demonstrating her inability to see the far-reaching consequences of her actions.
Beforehand, Cersei was known to have an extremely thinly-veiled sense of morality, which can be attributed to her love for her own children, no matter how twisted it was. Now that Tommen, Joffrey and Myrcella are all dead, however, Cersei has begun displaying more ruthlessness and depravity in her convictions. Her use of wildfire to destroy the Great Sept of Baelor can be considered somewhat of a symbolic envoi to her own descent into the same level of tyranny as the the Mad King. This act also destroyed the area surrounding the Great Sept for half a mile, effectively murdering hundreds of innocent people. Ironically, this may serve to drive a wedge between her and Jaime; Jaime outright said that the only thing he cares about is Cersei and that he was willing to kill even children if it reunited them, but Cersei has committed an act similar to the one he had to kill the Mad King for. Jaime's grim look upon returning to King's Landing and witnessing her coronation means that he understands that she is becoming exactly like him.
Regarding her own crimes, Cersei appears to have become shamelessly sadistic. She outwardly admits that all her actions from having Robert killed to having an incestuous relationship with Jaime was solely because she enjoyed doing so. This, she ""confesses"" to a helpless Unella while vengefully playing with her, even quietly chanting ""shame"" (in a similar sense that Unella did during her walk of atonement) before leaving her to be tortured by Gregor Clegane.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, Lady of Casterly Rock, Lady Paramount of the Westerlands, Queen Mother (formerly), Queen Regent (formerly), Queen Consort (formerly)",Alive,"","Casterly Rock, the Westerlands",House Lannister,Andal,"","Tommen Baratheon (King of the, Andals and the First Men), Tywin Lannister (Lord Paramount of the Westerlands)","",Tywin Lannister,Joanna Lannister,Robert Baratheon,"Fathered by Robert Baratheon:, Unnamed sonFathered by Jaime Lannister:, Joffrey Baratheon, Myrcella Baratheon, Tommen Baratheon,","Jaime Lannister, Tyrion Lannister","Jaime Lannister, Lancel Lannister (formerly)",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c7/Queen_Cersei_Main_The_winds_of_Winter.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161215024728,Cersei Lannister,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d5/Promo_young_cersei_s5_ep1.jpg,Cersei as a young girl in Casterly Rock.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/c8/Robert_Cersei_wedding.jpg,Cersei marries Robert Baratheon.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/16/Cersei_at_Winterfell_feast.jpg,Cersei at the feast in Winterfell.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/15/Cersei-and-Jaime-lannister.jpg,Cersei makes love with her brother Jaime.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/61/Cersei-joffrey.png,Cersei and her eldest son Joffrey.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5e/Cersei_and_Robert.jpg,Cersei and Robert visit Ned.,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/65/Cerseiandned.png,Cersei reveals the truth to Ned Stark.,House Lannister

Tommen Baratheon,"King Tommen I Baratheon is a major character in the fifth and sixth seasons. He initially appeared as a recurring character in the first, second and fourth seasons. He is portrayed by starring cast member Dean-Charles Chapman, taking over the role (starting in Season 4) from Callum Wharry, who played the character briefly in Seasons 1 and 2, debuting in ""Winter is Coming"". Tommen was the younger brother of King Joffrey and Princess Myrcella. Though legally the son of the late King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, his true father is Ser Jaime Lannister, the Queen's twin brother. His sole biological grandparents, Tywin and Joanna Lannister, were also first cousins.
After his brother's death during his wedding to Margaery Tyrell, Tommen assumed the throne under the name of Tommen of the House Baratheon, the First of His Name. After witnessing the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor and learning of the death of his beloved Queen among all the casualites, Tommen committed suicide by jumping out of a window in the Red Keep.","Tommen is presented as the youngest son of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister. Cersei and Robert made a political marriage alliance after Robert took the throne by force from the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen. Tommen's real father is Jaime Lannister, his mother's twin brother and his uncle.
He has an older brother, Joffrey, and an older sister Myrcella with the same obfuscated parentage. Tommen is good-natured and passive in contrast to his brother Joffrey, who sometimes bullied Tommen for amusement. Like his sister, he is fond of his uncle Tyrion Lannister.","Throughout his life, it has been fundamentally clear that Tommen Baratheon's most prominent quality is that he is innocent. He has been the victim of his older brother Joffrey's intense cruelty, sadism and overindulgence by their mother, and this has set the two brothers apart quite considerably. Where Joffrey was arrogant, monstrous and a dolt, Tommen was compassionate, kind and sweet to a fault. Tommen was extremely emotional, crying helplessly when his sister Myrcella was sent to Dorne by Tyrion. He didn't stand up for himself when Joffrey callously mocked Tommen for crying, showing that at this point Tommen was underconfident, especially where Joffrey was concerned because Joffrey had tormented his little brother his entire life. Tommen is so kind that he heartily says he doesn't want Joffrey to kill Robb Stark in battle, despite the fact that officially the Starks and Lannisters were in a pitched war with one another.
One of the most unfortunate elements of Tommen's innocence and kindness is that he is considerably easy to manipulate. This set him apart from Joffrey, who was wilful and fearsome in his own way and had to be disciplined into following others. Both Tywin Lannister and the High Sparrow saw this weakness in Tommen, and exploited it. That being said, Tywin had the decency to say that he thought Tommen would be a much better ruler than his psychopathic older brother was. In this exact same conversation, Tommen is shown to be surprisingly intelligent and didn't require much prompting to figure out what made a good king, without taking it as a criticism as Joffrey would have done. Tommen's intelligence didn't necessarily make him perceptive of people manipulating him, though.
Tommen's compassion stretched to shocking degrees, since he apologized and even speculated that he'd hurt Margaery when she cried out during the consummation of their marriage. Even after the mass expansion of rumors (Which, of course, are true) that Tommen and his siblings were products of incest between Cersei and Jaime, Tommen still loved his mother, but he did gain some independent emotions towards other people despite Cersei's best efforts. Tommen loved Margaery extremely deeply and expressed uncharacteristic anger and frustration when confronting the High Sparrow and demanding Margaery's release. Tommen's love for Margaery was so powerful that, when he saw the Great Sept of Baelor explode in a blaze of wildfire, and knew immediately that Margaery and her family who were inside it had been exterminated, he immediately removed his crown and silently, calmly, threw himself from the window to his death, showing that he couldn't envision life in a world without Margaery.","1, 2, 4, 5, 6","King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms[1], Lord of Storm's End, Lord Paramount of the Stormlands",Deceased,Committed suicide by jumping from a window in the Red Keep,King's Landing,"House Baratheon of King's, Landing, Faith of  Seven",Andal,Faith of the Seven,Joffrey Baratheon,Cersei Lannister,"Jaime Lannister (biological), Robert Baratheon (legal)",Cersei Lannister,Margaery Tyrell,"","Joffrey Baratheon, Myrcella Baratheon, Unnamed Baratheon (maternal half-brother)","",http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7c/Tommen_blood_of_my_blood.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160530234845,Tommen Baratheon,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/17/Tyrion_and_Tommen_1x02.png,Tyrion and Tommen,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f6/House_Baratheon_of_King%27s_Landing.jpg,Tommen seated with the rest of the royal family at the Tourney of the Hand,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/02/Myrcella_Tommen_dinner_with_Sansa.jpg,Tommen and Myrcella,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/72/Tommen_cries_at_Myrcella%27s_departure.jpg,Tommen cries as Myrcella departs for Dorne.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5c/Cersei_and_Tommen_Blackwater_Promo.jpg,Cersei and Tommen during the Battle of Blackwater,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f0/Tommen-and-Cersei.jpg,Tommen and Cersei mourn over Joffrey's death.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/cc/Margaerytommen.png,Margaery visits Tommen in his bedchambers.,""

Daario Naharis,"Daario Naharis is a major character in the fifth and sixth seasons. He initially appeared as a recurring character in the third and fourth seasons. He is played by starring cast member Michiel Huisman, taking over the role from guest star Ed Skrein, who briefly portrayed the character in Season 3.
Originally a lieutenant in the Second Sons, a sellsword company, Daario takes over the company after killing his superiors Mero and Prendahl na Ghezn and then aligns with Daenerys Targaryen. Daario serves Daenerys as her advisor and enforcer, and also eventually becomes her lover, but he is forced to part ways with her when she sails for Westeros, remaining in the Bay of Dragons to enforce the Queen's peace.","Daario is a Tyroshi sellsword, employed as a lieutenant in the Second Sons. He is apparently held in high enough regard by the company's co-captains, Mero and Prendahl na Ghezn, that they allow him to join them in contract negotiations and discussions of the company's future.
According to Daario, his mother was a prostitute, and he comes from low beginnings. At the age of 12, Daario was sold by his mother to a slave master from Tolos due to her declining income, alcoholism and his aggressive, unruly behavior and tendency to get into fights with other boys. He was trained as a pit fighter and had his first match in the pits when he was 16. Daario rose to fame within the fighting pits earning his master so much money that at the time of his master's death Daario was rewarded with freedom. Daario chose to fight as a sellsword for the Second Sons sometime after that.
Besides being fluent in the Common Tongue, Daario is also fluent in High Valyrian due to his Tyroshi origin. Daario also seems to speak some Dothraki, though it is unknown if he is fluent in it.
Daario has an unusual code for a sellsword; he won't sleep with prostitutes and only kills soldiers who are trying to kill him, not bystanders. He does this because he feels that otherwise there is no sport and it is not exciting. Daario has said that the gods gave men two things to entertain themselves with before they die: the thrill of having sex with a woman who earnestly wants it, and the thrill of killing a man who is trying to kill you first.
Daario is a highly skilled and capable warrior. Being trained a pit fighter since the age of 12 and then fighting as a sellsword after that, mostly all of Daario's life has revolved around fighting. During his years as a pit fighter he learned to fight with several different fighting styles; like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest and a Westerosi knight. Daario has over several different occasions proven his skills in combat: when he reveals to Daenerys that he single-handedly managed to kill both of the commanding officers of the Second Sons, when he along Ser Jorah and Grey Worm fight severly outnumbered against several guards in the streets of Yunkai, when he kills the Champion of Meereen in single combat with ease or when protecting Daenerys, Tyrion, and Missandei from hundreds of Sons of the Harpy along with Ser Jorah, coming out on top, unharmed, despite being outnumbered severely.
Daario's weapons-of-choice are a Dothraki arakh and a Myrish stiletto, both which have gold-plated custom-made hilts in the shape of beautiful, naked women. His fighting style is based on speed and quick, accurate strikes with few, mostly finishing, blows based on pure strength due to his relatively small size and lean build compared to the larger, stronger opponents he frequently faced in the fighting pits.","","3, 4, 5, 6","Commander of the Second Sons, Acting Regent of the Bay of Dragons",Alive,"","Tyrosh, the Free Cities","Second Sons, House Targaryen",Tyroshi,"","","","",Unnamed mother,"","","",Daenerys Targaryen (formerly),http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/d8/Daario-s6e4.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160512195958,Daario Naharis,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e1/Daario_threatens_Missandei.jpg,Daario (dressed as an Unsullied) holds a knife at Missandei's throat.,http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/71/Game_between_daario_and_grey_worm.png,"Daario gambling with Grey Worm.

Walder Frey,"Lord Walder Frey is a recurring character in the first, third, and sixth seasons, played by guest star David Bradley and debuting in Baelor. He is the Lord of the Crossing, Lord of Riverrun, Lord Paramount of the Trident, and the head of House Frey, the Great House of the Riverlands, and a former vassal house to House Tully, the previous Great House which he betrayed at the Red Wedding. He is eventually murdered by Arya Stark in retaliation for the Red Wedding, where he had also betrayed House Stark.","Walder Frey is the Lord of the Crossing and the head of House Frey, a vassal family of House Tully of the Riverlands. His house is noted for its overwhelming fertility and he has over one hundred descendants. He rules The Twins and its surrounding lands, controlling the strategically important crossing of the Green Fork. Over the years, this great stone bridge and the castles that control it have made House Frey a fortune in crossing fees. Lord Walder been married seven times and is almost ninety years old when the series begins.
He is referred to by his liege lord, Hoster Tully, as the ""Late Lord Frey"" after delaying his arrival to assist Robert's Rebellion until the outcome had already been determined.","Walder Frey is shown to be an arrogant, domineering, sarcastic, lecherous, and tyrannical man who possesses no shame. He openly admits how little he thinks of the oaths he swears to other houses due to his strategic position, which he uses to extort hefty tolls in exchange for his allegiance, and shows a willingness to switch sides if he thinks it will benefit him more. Walder may see to it that his numerous progeny, trueborn and baseborn alike, are provided for but only to further assert his own position. In truth, his ire towards Robb after he broke his vow had nothing whatsoever to do with any slight to his daughters and granddaughters but rather to his house.
Despite his advanced age, however, Walder shows little thought or concern for what happens to his house after he dies because like other characters, namely Cersei Lannister and Ramsay Bolton, he is extremely self-centered, not fully considering the long-term consequences of his actions. In addition, Walder Frey is extremely callous. When he meets Jaime Lannister, he speaks with the man as if they are equals (although Jaime has personally killed many men while Walder merely sat and watched as others died), calling himself a conqueror. He also credited himself as a kingslayer like Jaime for his involvement in the Red Wedding, even though it had been Roose Bolton who had killed Robb Stark. Walder Frey had barely even got up from his seat during the massacre, and yet he credited himself with the deaths of greater men and women than himself.
Jaime is quick to point this out, and the fact that Walder views his house as a feared one for eliminating the Tullys on two occasions, even though he is simply loathed. Furthermore, he required very considerable support from Tywin Lannister for the Red Wedding, and he did not participate personally in taking Riverrun. Walder gloated that Brynden Tully had fallen to foot soldiers, even though he had never personally stepped into combat, considering generally defeating one's enemy to be a victory - the very fact that he considered himself (an old man who called for the aid of stronger people to achieve his victories) to be on par with Jaime Lannister (who actually killed his king and was trained by heroes, and has participated in actual battles) shows that Walder is narrow-minded. He considers the fact that his enemies are dead and he is not to be a personal victory, and he acts like a strong, respected man and a crucial ally, when he is not essentially a valued ally of the Lannisters.
In his final moments, however, Walder's swagger crumbles instantly when he is caught off guard by Arya with no one to protect him, and he shows his cowardice when he attempts to flee before she kills him.","1, 3, 6","Lord of the Crossing, Lord of Riverrun, Lord Paramount of the Trident",Deceased,"Throat slit by Arya Stark, , after feeding him Frey pie",The Twins,"House Frey, House Tully",Andal,Faith of the Seven,Edmure Tully,"","","","Joyeuse Erenford (eighth wife), Kitty Frey (ninth wife)","Stevron Frey, Lothar Frey, Olyvar Frey, Waldron Frey, Arwaya Frey, Walda Frey, Derwa Frey, Waldra Frey, Roslin Tully, Shirei Frey, Walder Rivers, Ryger Rivers, Many others","","",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e4/S06E06_-_Walder_Frey_Cropped_new.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161215025257,Walder Frey,http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/da/Late_Freys.png,"Walder's army reaches the Trident after the battle, earning him the nickname ""the Late Lord Frey"" from Hoster Tully.",http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/dc/Walder_and_Joyeuse_1x09.png,Walder Frey and his new fifteen-year-old wife Joyeuse Erenford.,http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/35/WalderFreyedWedding.jpg,Walder Frey watches the massacre of the Red Wedding,http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/17/AryaKillsWalderFrey.jpg,Walder Frey's throat is sliced open by Arya Stark.,"","","","","","",House Frey

During his reign, he had the Maidenvault built inside the Red Keep and imprisoned his three sisters to prevent carnal temptations.
Though famed for his holiness and piety, he was also a religious zealot. Among Baelor's follies, he named a six year old boy as High Septon because he was convinced the child could work miracles after he talked to a dove. He also gave the title to a simple stonemason because he believed he was The Smith reincarnated. Baelor was also saved his cousin Aemon Targaryen from a snake pit, thinking that the vipers would not harm a man who was so devoted to the Faith. However, he was bitten twelve times and was forced to say in bed for six months. He starved himself into an early grave with his frequent religious fasting, believing that the Known world was sinful and food was from the Known world.
