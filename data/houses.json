It rules over the Reach, a vast, fertile, and heavily-populated region of southwestern Westeros, from their castle-seat, Highgarden. Formerly led by Lord Mace Tyrell, his mother, the indomitable Olenna Tyrell, stands as the last known member of the house. Mace's son Loras was a noted tournament knight (and, secretly, the lover of Lord Renly Baratheon). Mace's daughter Margaery married Renly when he crowned himself king, to cement the alliance between Renly and her father. Following Renly's death, Margaery was then married to King Joffrey Baratheon before his assassination at his wedding feast. She was then married to his younger brother, King Tommen Baratheon. Olenna Tyrell assumed House Tyrell's lordship as Margaery Tyrell, Loras Tyrell, and Mace Tyrell were killed by wildfire by at the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor. Under Lady Olenna, who has served as the head of the house since, House Tyrell has aligned itself with House Targaryen in opposition against Queen Cersei I for orchestrating the demise of most of the main branch of the Tyrell family.\nThe Tyrell sigil is a golden rose on a pale green field. Their words are, \"Growing Strong\".","background":"House Tyrell began as a cadet branch of House Gardener, the ancient Kings of the Reach. The Tyrells became senior servants of the main Gardener line, serving for centuries as castellans of the royal castle at Highgarden. Over time they rose to prominence as one of the strongest noble Houses in the Reach, and even intermarried with the royal line - though so did many other powerful Houses from the Reach.  During the Targaryen Conquest, King Mern Gardener was burned alive at the Field of Fire by the Targaryen dragons, along with all of his immediate heirs. Subsequently, Mern's steward Harlen Tyrell voluntarily surrendered Highgarden to Aegon Targaryen. Aegon rewarded Harlen by making him Lord of Highgarden and Lord Paramount of the Reach - ahead of other Houses from the Reach which were actually more closely related to House Gardener. Chief among these is House Florent of Brightwater Keep, which claims direct male-line descent from the old Gardener kings, while House Tyrell only claim descent from House Gardener through the female line.\nHouse Tyrell's overall disposition is adequately represented by their sigil of a rose: a rose's beauty often hides the fact that it has thorns. Though the Tyrells do try to be just and fair, their benevolent demeanor serves to lull their enemies into thinking that, like the Starks, they are utterly beholden to honorable conduct. In reality, the Tyrells are just as cunning as the Lannisters in court politics and intrigue, though they often prefer a more subtle approach. Thus they strike a pragmatic balance between the Starks' honor and the Lannisters' ruthlessness.  Throughout history, House Tyrell has played by the strategy of following the sure path, siding with whoever is most likely to win in any conflict. During the Targaryen Conquest, they surrendered Highgarden to the invading forces of Aegon the Conqueror, and in return the Tyrells were elevated as the new Lords Paramount of the Reach. During Robert's Rebellion, House Tyrell remained loyal to House Targaryen, as Robert Baratheon was a rebel unlikely to win, and the Tyrells owed their rule of the Reach to the Targaryens. Forces of House Tyrell managed to inflict the only loss Robert suffered during the war, albeit an indecisive one, at the Battle of Ashford. However, the vast army and resources of House Tyrell were tied up on a siege of Storm's End (held for Robert by his brother; Stannis Baratheon). After the Mad King's death, the Tyrells surrendered and swore fealty to Robert Baratheon. \nIn the current generation, House Tyrell is a stable and honestly loving family, with none of the internal rivalries that are to be found in House Lannister and House Baratheon. Thus the relationships between Lord Mace and his children, and between siblings like Loras and Margaery, are genuine and uncomplicated.","words":"\"Growing Strong\"","seat":"Highgarden","region":"The Reach","lord":"Lady Olenna Tyrell","religion":null,"sigil_url":"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/cf/House-Tyrell-Main-Shield.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20170108163035","sigil":"A golden rose on a green field","images_attributes":[{"src":"http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0c/House_Tyrell_banner.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20110408162416","caption":"The banner of  of Highgarden, the rulers of the Reach."},{"src":"http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b7/Harlen_Tyrell_surrender_to_Aegon_the_Conqueror.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20130615085357","caption":"Harlen Tyrell surrenders to Aegon the Conqueror."},{"src":"http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/35/Tyrell_surrender_to_Robert.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20130615075308","caption":"Mace Tyrell surrenders to Robert Baratheon."}]},{"name":"House Tully","description":"House Tully of Riverrun is an exiled Great House of Westeros.

After the obliteration of Valyria in the Doom, the Targaryens launched a devastating invasion of Westeros using three dragons to spearhead their attack. In a short period of time, six of the seven formerly independent kingdoms had surrendered to the Targaryen leader, King Aegon I, unifying the continent under his rule. The last hold-out, Dorne, joined the kingdom through a political and marriage alliance some two centuries later.\nDuring the increasingly erratic reign of King Aerys II, his son Rhaegar was said to have kidnapped Lyanna Stark of Winterfell for unknown reasons. When Lyanna's brother Brandon protested, Aerys responded by having both him and his father Rickard Stark arrested and executed. This sparked a massive uprising led by Eddard Stark, Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn. At the end of this war Aerys and Rhaegar were dead and the Targaryen power-base in Westeros destroyed. Aerys's youngest children, Viserys and Daenerys, were taken by Targaryen loyalists into exile in the Free Cities of the East.\nGenerations of compound inbreeding have preserved in the Targaryen bloodline the classic Valyrian features of silver-white (platinum blonde) hair, and very fair, pale skin. Allegedly, this also preserved in their bloodline the ability to successfully bond with and ride dragons.

Their motto of the House is \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\"​.\nWith the assassinations of Prince Doran Martell and his only heir, Prince Trystane, by Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes, House Martell is legally extinct, although the Sand Snakes themselves carry Martell blood through their father Oberyn. The Sand Snakes also continue to use the Martell sigil to represent themselves and Dorne.\nUnder the leadership of Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes, the forces of House Martell and Dorne have aligned to support the cause of Daenerys Targaryen, against House Lannister after they declared war against them.","background":"House Martell started out as local kings in Dorne, which was long divided between many petty kings of the First Men and Andals. About a thousand years ago, Rhoynar refugees fleeing conquest by the Valyrian Freehold in Essos migrated across the Narrow Sea to Dorne, led by their warrior-queen Nymeria. Mors Martell was smitten with Nymeria and chose to join forces with her through marriage-alliance. With their combined strength, they conquered and unified the rest of Dorne. To symbolize their union, the original golden spear sigil of Mors Martell was combined with the red sun sigil of Nymeria, creating the red sun pierced by a golden spear sigil that House Martell has used ever since. Like their Rhoynar ancestors, House Martell styled its rulers as \"princes\" instead of \"kings\".\nThe Martell words are \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\" - referring to their history, in which they have never been successfully conquered by outsiders. This makes them unique among all of the Great Houses. During the Targaryen Conquest (three centuries before the War of the Five Kings), Dorne was the only region of the Seven Kingdoms to successfully resist the Targaryens and their dragons. Realizing that large armies could not stand against dragons (as seen at the Field of Fire), nor large castles (as seen at the Burning of Harrenhal), the Dornish instead resorted to guerrilla warfare, ambushing Targaryen soldiers and harassing their supply lines as soon as their dragons moved on to the next castle, then disappearing back into the harsh deserts when the dragons returned. The heat of Dorne's deserts also worked to the Martells' advantage, as Dorne's arid climate cannot easily support large invading armies. Losing many men due to attrition, ultimately even Aegon the Conqueror decided to withdraw from Dorne, to focus on reining in the other six newly conquered kingdoms.\nHouse Martell and Dorne have never been successfully conquered. Over a century and a half after the Targaryen Conquest of the rest of Westeros, they were invaded again by King Daeron I Targaryen, the Young Dragon. A military genius, his Conquest of Dorne actually succeeded - on the battlefield. But the initial conquest was followed by a four year long Dornish insurgency, in which occupying troops were again bled through ambush and guerrilla tactics. Lyonel Tyrell, the steward that Daeron I put in charge of Dorne, was then assassinated, and all of Dorne rose up in open rebellion. Daeron I himself was killed attempting to put down the insurrection, and after only four short years House Martell once again ruled an independent Dorne.\nA few decades later (a little over a century before the War of the Five Kings), King Daeron II the Good managed to finally unite Dorne with the Iron Throne - not through conquest, but by voluntary marriage-alliance on equal terms. Daeron II married the sister of the Prince of Dorne, and the Prince of Dorne married Daeron II's sister. This special, semi-autonomous status allowed Dorne to retain several special privileges, such as the Martells continuing to style themselves as \"Prince\" or \"Princess\" instead of \"Lord Paramount\" and continuing their practice of gender-blind primogeniture. This union did cause several political tensions at the royal court between Daeron II's pro-Martell faction and anti-Martell lords (from the Reach, the Stormlands, and the Dornish Marches), eventually leading to the Blackfyre Rebellion.\nGenerations later, King Aerys II Targaryen (later known as \"the Mad King\") had no daughters, so he sought a suitable bride for his son Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen from outside of the family. Aerys II chose to snub the offer of Tywin Lannister, his own trusted Hand of the King and dutiful servant, that Rhaegar marry his own young daughter Cersei. Instead, a match was arranged with the then-current Princess of Dorne to wed her daughter Elia Martell to Rhaegar.\nIn Robert's Rebellion, Elia was kept in King's Landing to ensure the continued allegiance of House Martell to the Targaryen's against the rebels. Elia bore Rhaegar two children but all three were later killed during Robert's Rebellion, during the Sack of King's Landing by Tywin Lannister's army. Elia's brothers Doran and Oberyn were outraged and, while peace was restored, the Martells withdrew from interacting with the royal court. During King Robert Baratheon's subsequent reign, the Martells and Dorne were rarely if ever even mentioned at court, except for their Dornish wine.","words":"\"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\"","seat":"Sunspear","region":"Dorne","lord":"Ellaria Sand (de facto), Extinct (officially)","religion":null,"sigil_url":"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7e/House-Martell-Main-Shield.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20160312085543","sigil":"A red sun pierced by a gold spear, on an orange field","images_attributes":[{"src":"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/20/Nymeria_Ten_Thousand_Ships.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20150410223335","caption":"Nymeria led the Rhoynar refugee fleet in a massive migration to Dorne, fleeing the Valyrians."},{"src":"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/70/Dorne_resists_the_Targaryen_Conquest.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20150410213031","caption":"The Martells resisted the Targaryen conquest by resorting to guerrilla warfare: if a dragon came the Dornish hid in the desert until it left, then ambushed the Targaryens' supply lines, until they eventually withdrew."},{"src":"http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/6d/Daeron%27s_death.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20150203111958","caption":"King Daeron I Targaryen's invasion of Dorne lasted only 4 years, ending with the death of Daeron I, along with 60,000 of his men, and the Martells still defiantly independent."},{"src":"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/8f/Targaryen_Martell_two_marriages.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20150410223058","caption":"The double marriage-alliance that united the Martells with the Iron Throne: King Daeron II Targaryen married Prince Maron Martell's sister Myriah (left), and Prince Maron married Daeron II's sister Daenerys (right)."},{"src":"http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4a/Slaughter.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20130416000518","caption":"At the end of Robert's Rebellion, Lannister bannerman Gregor Clegane killed Elia Martell's children, then raped and killed Elia."},{"src":"http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/99/Nymeria_and_Mors_Martell.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20150316165321","caption":"Mors Martell and Nymeria united to conquer and unify Dorne.
