An HBO Project
================
This is an HBO project, created to organize all our Game of Thrones data.
The [Game of Thrones Wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_Wiki) 
is gathering a lot of data and information about the serie, but with time, 
it has become a bit complicated to keep it organized.

## Organizing the data
The idea of this project is to transition from the flexibility of a wiki 
to the structure of an app, keeping data can better organized and easier to share.
The transition starts with Houses and Characters as a first step, before taking 
over the rest of the data.

## State of the project
This project is open to the public as is the Wiki, meaning it is important to keep 
in mind that any user can import and enter data. 
It is already deployed in production and already in active use internally. 
It is tested and managed by the producers and production team of Game of Thrones 
who are the backers of this project.

## New features and bug tracker
The management of the project is done within Gitlab. New features and bugs are 
defined in the [issues](/../issues) section.

## Data in development
The house data can be added with the seed script from the [houses.json file](/data/houses.json).
The character CSV file to be imported is located in the [data folder](/data/got_characters.csv)
